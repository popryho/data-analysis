Do you want to know more about it? Kindly follow the article.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>What is WannaCry Ransomware?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><strong>WannaCry<\/strong> is a type of Ransomware worm that affected many corporate and spread across Microsoft users in May 2017. Like other Crypto-Ransomware, it takes data hostages and demands a large sum of ransoms in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.<\/p>\n<p>Ransomware is malware that enters the computer and gets full access to the affected system. It demands a ransom from the user to let the system work again. The ransom can be in the money and other forms.<\/p>\n<p>When the ransomware encrypts the data in the PC and demands a ransom to release them, it is called Crypto-ransomware.\u00a0 WannaCry is one of them. <strong>The literal meaning of the word WannaCry is &#8211; &#8220;Want to decrypt?&#8221;<\/strong> \u00a0In the case of WannaCry ransomware, attackers demanded $300 &#8211; $600 as ransom in the form of Bitcoin.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>History of WannaCry Attack<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The first evidence of the attack was found in Asia on Friday, 12 May 2017. The ransomware infection spread rapidly between the networks of computers through Eternal Blue an exposed Vulnerability of Microsoft window. Within the day, the infection spread to more than 2, 30,000 computers in over 150 countries.<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately, Microsoft has already released a security patch for the Eternal Blue Exploit one month before the attack. Thus only those who didn&#8217;t update to the Microsoft new patch were affected by this attack.\u00a0 The attack was halted in the next four days by the cybersecurity peoples through new patches and the discovery of the kill switch.<\/p>\n<p>There were more than 3,00,000 infected computers and 2,00,000 victims. Many nations asserted North Korea or the agencies working for the country as the one behind the attack. But still today, the suspect remains anonymous and not arrested.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\"><strong>Related :<\/strong><\/span> <em><strong><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/ipwithease.com\/network-vulnerabilities-and-the-osi-model\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" style=\"color: #0000ff;\" target=\"_blank\">Network Vulnerabilities and the OSI Model<\/a><\/span><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<h2><strong>What is Eternal Blue Exploit?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><strong>Eternal Blue<\/strong> is a Cyber Vulnerability in the implementation of Server Message Block (SMB) of Microsoft Windows found by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA). Instead of reporting, they used it for their offensive purpose. Then, it was stolen and released by the mysterious hacker group named the shadow Brokers.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>How does it Work?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The hackers induce the WannaCry code through the Eternal Blue exploit. During the attack, the shadow brokers released a backdoor tool \u2013 Double Pulsar. It is a tool that helps to bypass the normal authentication and encryption of the computers.<\/p>\n<p>The WannaCry takes advantage of the already installed Double Pulsar or installs it, to access the information and grasp the control of the system. An interesting character about it is, it doesn&#8217;t reveal itself once it entered the computer. It dives deep inside to find the URL (<strong>so-called <a href=\"https:\/\/networkinterview.com\/what-is-a-kill-switch-in-vpn\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">&#8220;kill Switch&#8221;<\/span><\/a><\/strong>). Experts are unsure about the reason behind this function.<\/p>\n<p>If it cannot find it, then it starts to encrypt all the files on the computer. The files can be in any format (Microsoft files, Mp3, Mkv). When the user tries to access the file, it displays a ransom notice demanding $300 to $600 to release or regain the files.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Do WannaCry attacks still exist? <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><strong>Marcus Hutchins<\/strong>, the British Cybersecurity expert discovered the code&#8217;s search for the URL. His discovery of the kill switch reduced the spread of ransomware but didn&#8217;t stop it.\u00a0 On the other side, the patch for Eternal Blue exploit was released by the Microsoft team. These two factors brought the attack to end.<\/p>\n<p>However, in recent times we are facing a new variant of the Eternal Blue Exploit. In 2018, a new variant of WannaCry attacked the <strong>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC<\/strong>) forcing it to shut down its business. In that year, Boeing experienced the same. However, they were able to recover fast due to the availability of security patches.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>How to prevent yourself?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>As the WannCry make use of the same exploit, it shows there are still more computers that remain not patched. Though the WannCry targets only the windows, it is better to take the following prevention measures in all your electronic gadgets including phones, androids, and tablets.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keep your systems updated to the new version released by the vendor.<\/li>\n<li>Backup all your information, as the instance of getting back the data after the ransom is very low.<\/li>\n<li>Update all your security software to face the recent threats.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\">Continue Reading:<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><em><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/ipwithease.com\/blind-sql-injection-prevention-and-consequences\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" style=\"color: #0000ff;\" target=\"_blank\">Blind SQL Injection<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p><em><strong><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/ipwithease.com\/introduction-to-rainbow-table-cyber-attack\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" style=\"color: #0000ff;\" target=\"_blank\">Rainbow Table : Cyber Attack<\/a><\/span><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p><a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Fwannacry-ransomware-fully-explained%2F&amp;linkname=WannaCry%20Ransomware%20Fully%20Explained\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Facebook\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Fwannacry-ransomware-fully-explained%2F&amp;linkname=WannaCry%20Ransomware%20Fully%20Explained\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Twitter\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_linkedin\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Fwannacry-ransomware-fully-explained%2F&amp;linkname=WannaCry%20Ransomware%20Fully%20Explained\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"LinkedIn\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_whatsapp\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/whatsapp?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Fwannacry-ransomware-fully-explained%2F&amp;linkname=WannaCry%20Ransomware%20Fully%20Explained\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"WhatsApp\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_email\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Fwannacry-ransomware-fully-explained%2F&amp;linkname=WannaCry%20Ransomware%20Fully%20Explained\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Email\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_reddit\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Fwannacry-ransomware-fully-explained%2F&amp;linkname=WannaCry%20Ransomware%20Fully%20Explained\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Reddit\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_pinterest\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/pinterest?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Fwannacry-ransomware-fully-explained%2F&amp;linkname=WannaCry%20Ransomware%20Fully%20Explained\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pinterest\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_counter addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Fwannacry-ransomware-fully-explained%2F&#038;title=WannaCry%20Ransomware%20Fully%20Explained\"><\/a><\/p>"

And the ability to create applications is among them. Programming is in-demand these days. It simplifies our lives in different terms. Whatever aspect you take, programming is there.<\/p>\n<p>It is good to know widely used languages to be a competent professional. And you don\u2019t have to obtain a relevant degree to apply for a job. Many corporations hire amateurs if they see their potential. Still, a degree is a useful token showing that you had intentions to become a programmer a long time ago. So, if you started doing a programming degree, make sure to finish it, and this <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/assignmentshark.com\/programming-homework-help.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" style=\"color: #0000ff;\" target=\"_blank\">programming homework help<\/a><\/span> will be of an excellent assistant.<\/p>\n<h2>List of Top Programming Languages For Mobile Apps<\/h2>\n<p>You may get confused with the number of programming languages existing these days. Each of them is used for different purposes. Nonetheless, if you want to enter the mobile app developing world, pay close attention to the following list.<\/p>\n<h3>Python<\/h3>\n<p>Python is the most popular language these days. And it comes as no surprise because Python offers a beautiful interface, a simple structure, and extraordinary user-friendliness. Not only will you be able to create mobile applications when using Python, but also you might create desktop GUIs, analyze various data, and even delve into Natural Language Processing! Python is arguably the most taught language in educational institutions. More colleges switch to teaching Python because it is almost effortless to learn!<\/p>\n<p>Even if you are not a student, you can learn the ropes of <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/ipwithease.com\/python-interview-questions\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" style=\"color: #0000ff;\" target=\"_blank\">Python<\/a> <\/span>online. There are thousands of guides on how to learn this language. You don\u2019t have to pay for courses and hire tutors to understand Python. Keep in mind that although Python is the easiest language, it plays a pivotal role in developing such applications as YouTube, Instagram, Quora, Spotify, and games like Battlefield and World of Tanks.<\/p>\n<h3>JavaScript<\/h3>\n<p>If you are up for challenges, JavaScript is definitely for you. Being one of the most complicated languages, it is also one of the founding fathers of programming. JavaScript appeared dozens of years ago. Nonetheless, it is updated continuously, and many novel features make JavaScript a more preferred language day by day.<\/p>\n<p>Whatever gadgets and apps people use\u2014be they PCs, smartphones, laptops, or tablets\u2014they rely on JavaScript. The language works within different platforms. You don\u2019t have to adjust the code to different systems to make it work because JavaScript does it for you and makes the application compatible with Android and iOS.<\/p>\n<h3>Rust<\/h3>\n<p>If you have a UNIX-based system and want to use it for developing purposes, Rust is the best option. The language is maintained by Mozilla. The same as the browser itself, Rust is famous for its code protection and overall safety. It is a practical language that firmly holds its position among the best programming tools for developing applications.<\/p>\n<p>The language is also known for its smooth integrity with other systems; Rust establishes efficient boundaries to prevent unexpected errors when working with adjacent systems. Also, Rust is mostly valuable for its efficient scanning for errors. Thanks to Rust, developers can catch bugs during the early stage and write flawless code.<\/p>\n<h3>Scala<\/h3>\n<p>Scala has recently appeared in the programming industry, and its success is hard to overestimate. Scala is an object-oriented language that prioritizes functional programming and problem-solving Java can hardly deal with.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, Scala uses and changes information with Java to boost efficiency. The language is relatively hard to learn, so ensure selecting it if you already have app development experience.<\/p>\n<h3>Ruby<\/h3>\n<p>Ruby is a dark horse in the app developing industry. Scarcely is it picked by people who want to create applications. However, the benefits of using Ruby are evident.<\/p>\n<p>First and foremost, over 4 million active developers use Ruby to coin apps. This makes Ruby the top-three language after Python and JavaScript. Secondly, it has collected all the best attributes from substantial languages like Ada and Perl. Thirdly, Ruby is flexible, and it allows programmers to work with a number of paradigms.<\/p>\n<h3>Swift<\/h3>\n<p>If creating apps for Apple devices is your goal, Swift is the best language for your intentions. You can use it to develop programs for iOS. Experts claim Swift to be simple and rapid, which is an excellent substitute for the previous Objective. And even though it is primarily used for coining apps for iOS, people use it on Linux. The outcomes of using Swift on Linux are impressive and promising.<\/p>\n<h3>Java<\/h3>\n<p>In turn, if you feel like working more with Android systems, hardly can Java be replaced by any other language. Java is a versatile, object-oriented programming language. It enables people to work by using or not using a browser.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to Java, many apps have come to life. And even though Java is not for iOS developers, it is still beneficial when creating cross-platform programs and testing them. Aside from using Java to develop mobile apps, the language also focuses on creating games, web pages, and many more.<\/p>\n<h2>Wrapping Up<\/h2>\n<p>The mentioned list comprises the best programming languages developers utilize to build applications. There is no need to compare them, as each and every language is unique and has its quirks and advantages over others.<\/p>\n<p>It is only you who choose which programming language is the best for your purposes. Undoubtedly, if you focus on iOS, Swift will be much more useful compared to Java. In turn, if Android is your beloved system, Java will arguably be the best option. Either way, good luck with this thorny, sometimes overwhelming, yet stunning and reputable craft!<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\">Continue Reading:<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><em><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/ipwithease.com\/java-vs-python\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" style=\"color: #0000ff;\" target=\"_blank\">Java vs Python<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><em><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/ipwithease.com\/java-interview-questions\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" style=\"color: #0000ff;\" target=\"_blank\">JAVA Interview Questions<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Sponsored Post<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Fbest-programming-languages-for-mobile-apps%2F&amp;linkname=Best%20Programming%20Languages%20for%20Mobile%20Apps\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Facebook\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Fbest-programming-languages-for-mobile-apps%2F&amp;linkname=Best%20Programming%20Languages%20for%20Mobile%20Apps\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Twitter\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_linkedin\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Fbest-programming-languages-for-mobile-apps%2F&amp;linkname=Best%20Programming%20Languages%20for%20Mobile%20Apps\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"LinkedIn\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_whatsapp\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/whatsapp?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Fbest-programming-languages-for-mobile-apps%2F&amp;linkname=Best%20Programming%20Languages%20for%20Mobile%20Apps\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"WhatsApp\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_email\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Fbest-programming-languages-for-mobile-apps%2F&amp;linkname=Best%20Programming%20Languages%20for%20Mobile%20Apps\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Email\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_reddit\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Fbest-programming-languages-for-mobile-apps%2F&amp;linkname=Best%20Programming%20Languages%20for%20Mobile%20Apps\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Reddit\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_pinterest\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/pinterest?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Fbest-programming-languages-for-mobile-apps%2F&amp;linkname=Best%20Programming%20Languages%20for%20Mobile%20Apps\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pinterest\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_counter addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Fbest-programming-languages-for-mobile-apps%2F&#038;title=Best%20Programming%20Languages%20for%20Mobile%20Apps\"><\/a><\/p>"

To understand it better, you should know what SQL Injection is.<\/p>\n<p>SQL injection is the attacking technique, where attackers insert a malicious SQL statement (query) in the entry field as an input. Attackers use it to exploit security vulnerability, steal, and alter data. It is the oldest and common form of cyber attacks and is mostly used to attack websites, but it can be used to exploit any SQL Database.<\/p>\n<p>In the case of Classic <span style=\"color: #000000;\">SQL injection<\/span>, the attacker can see the response of his SQL query through the error but, in the case of\u00a0 Blind SQL injection, the attacker is blind to the output of the SQL injection. It makes the SQL injection process difficult and time-consuming but not impossible.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>How does it work?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-15016 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/ipwithease.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/blind-sql-injection1.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Before getting started, you should understand how the website and database work. All the details of the user of a website are stored in the database. SQL is the language used to store, retrieve, and delete data. Here is an example for you.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say a user enters his login credentials in the site (user Id and password). Now the SQL code acts and checks the details entered with the database. If it matches, it retrieves the data of the particular user shows it to him. In other words, he is allowed to log in.<\/p>\n<p>Now let us see how the attackers use the SQL injection to get access to your account. The attackers enters the malicious SQL string in the User Id field. The server reads the input as SQL code instead of as an input. Now the server would show the error. By this, the attackers will know that the site is vulnerable to SQL injection.<\/p>\n<p>But web server administrators realize showing errors to the general public is not a good choice. So the servers stopped showing errors. However, it doesn&#8217;t get rid of the vulnerability.<\/p>\n<p>Attackers came up with the new technique called Blind SQL injection, where the attacker can still know whether the site is vulnerable to SQL injection even without the error messages. The <strong>Blind injection is operated in two ways,<\/strong> they are content-based and time-based.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>In content-based<\/strong>, Blind SQL injection the attackers ask true or false questions to the database through the SQL queries. If the website response is true, then it means the site is vulnerable to SQL injection.<\/li>\n<li><strong>In time-based<\/strong> SQL injection, the attackers analyze the site&#8217;s response time by making the database performing time-intensive. If the website does not respond immediately then the site is vulnerable to SQL injection.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>After, they make various requests or command to the server through the input field to exploit the server database. Sometimes SQL injection attack is executed with other cyber attacks like <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/ipwithease.com\/what-is-ddos-attack\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" style=\"color: #0000ff;\" target=\"_blank\">DDoS.<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Consequences of Blind SQL Injection Attacks<\/strong><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The attackers can steal sensitive user details, including login credentials, credit card numbers, and other personal information.

And he can make payments and take action in his name.<\/li>\n<li>The attackers can read, add, update, alter, or delete the data or tables from the site database or execute an administrative command.<\/li>\n<li>Through SQL injection one can gain completed control over the web applications\/operating system of the server.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>How to prevent Blind SQL injection?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Irrespective of the language and web development platform used, the administrator should use strong and follow the secure coding guidelines of<span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"> <a href=\"https:\/\/owasp.org\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" style=\"color: #0000ff;\" target=\"_blank\">OWASP<\/a>.<\/span><\/li>\n<li>Use Parameterized queries instead of dynamic queries as they read the input as a separate string instead of the SQL code.<\/li>\n<li>Inputs should be filtered and checked.

On the other hand, since CSRF requires the user to enter credentials, online contents for public pages are safe to use.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>How CSRF Attack Works<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>There two main type of techniques used in order to perform a CSRF Attack nowadays, both of them are briefly described as follows:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cross Site GET Request:<\/strong> In this type of method, the main concept is that the attacker sends a legitimate-looking<span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"> <a href=\"https:\/\/ipwithease.com\/what-is-http\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" style=\"color: #0000ff;\" target=\"_blank\">HTTP<\/a><\/span> request from the victim\u2019s browser.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>As a result, the website processes the request without the question, if it is sent by the actual user or from the CSRF attacker. A simple example of a HTTP Get request using the\u00a0 &lt;img&gt; tag. is the following:<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-14968 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/ipwithease.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/CSRF-ATTACK-2.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cross Site POST Request:<\/strong> In this method POST requests can also be equally susceptible to Cross Site GET Request method described earlier. However, a hacker will have to make use of JavaScript in order to succeed such an attack.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The following example of how an CSRF Attack can be abused using POST requests through the use of an &lt;iframe&gt; tag is following:<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-14969 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/ipwithease.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/CSRF-ATTACK-3.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Mitigation from CSRF Attacks<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-14970 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/ipwithease.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/CSRF-ATTACK-4.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Nowadays in the cyber community various precautions have been invented to avoid CSRF Attacks. Therefore, it is not impossible to fix this vulnerability. The most widely used methods are the following:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Same Origin Policy:<\/strong> In this method the main concept is to be sure about the authenticity, or in simple words, the assurance that all the requests originate from trusted sources and not malicious ones. This security measure also ensures that\u00a0the response from the server is also being sent to the intended application.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Synchronised (CSRF) Tokens:<\/strong> In this particular kind of precaution, there is an additional surety compared to the \u201cSame Origin Policy\u201d, described above, because special tokens are attached to the session tokens. This measure gives the advantage of secure communication for every update request from the server.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Double Submit Cookie Policy:<\/strong> In this kind of precaution method, in order to avoid a CSRF Attack, the strategy \u201c<span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/cross-site-request-forgery-csrf\/double-submit-cookie-pattern-65bb71d80d9f\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" style=\"color: #0000ff;\" target=\"_blank\">Double Submit Cookie<\/a><\/span>\u201d is applied in order to avoid saving a copy of the used token on the server. To be more specific, the server saves the matching token\u2019s value in a cookie instead of keeping it in the live session. At the time the server receives a request, a security check is performed about the legitimate origin of the cookie value.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>CAPTCHA:<\/strong> Although this method is applied to different kind of cyber-attacks, it is also effective against CSRF attack. As described above, CSRF attacks are based on execution of malicious scripts (payloads) by the attacker. This precaution needs user activity such as entering (Letters, Images, etc) that eliminates the exchange of malicious data.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>As we described earlier, hopefully the reader of this article will now obtain a full knowledge on how \u201cCSRF Attacks\u201d work and which Mitigation precaution measures need to be considered in order to avoid them.<\/p>\n<p>Important information have also been addressed on how \u201cSynchronized Tokens\u201d and validation of \u201cHTTP\u201d requests work in the cyber community, giving a simplified version to the simple reader and user of current technology.<\/p>\n<p>Hopefully, everyone will be safer on the Web and the Public Authorities will interact with Funding Research opportunities on how to deal with those threats.<\/p>\n<p>We encourage people to report any kind of malicious activity of their personal computing experience to the Local Police Department, as nowadays have created a lot of technologically advanced facilities to investigate further.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\">Continue Reading:<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><em><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/ipwithease.com\/introduction-to-rainbow-table-cyber-attack\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" style=\"color: #0000ff;\" target=\"_blank\">Introduction to Rainbow Table : Cyber Attack<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p><em><strong><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/ipwithease.com\/what-is-brute-force-attack-cyber-security\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" style=\"color: #0000ff;\" target=\"_blank\">What is Brute Force Attack?<\/a><\/span><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Fwhat-is-csrf-attack-cyber-attack%2F&amp;linkname=What%20is%20CSRF%20Attack%3F%20%E2%80%93%20Cyber%20Attack\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Facebook\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Fwhat-is-csrf-attack-cyber-attack%2F&amp;linkname=What%20is%20CSRF%20Attack%3F%20%E2%80%93%20Cyber%20Attack\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Twitter\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_linkedin\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Fwhat-is-csrf-attack-cyber-attack%2F&amp;linkname=What%20is%20CSRF%20Attack%3F%20%E2%80%93%20Cyber%20Attack\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"LinkedIn\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_whatsapp\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/whatsapp?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Fwhat-is-csrf-attack-cyber-attack%2F&amp;linkname=What%20is%20CSRF%20Attack%3F%20%E2%80%93%20Cyber%20Attack\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"WhatsApp\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_email\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Fwhat-is-csrf-attack-cyber-attack%2F&amp;linkname=What%20is%20CSRF%20Attack%3F%20%E2%80%93%20Cyber%20Attack\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Email\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_reddit\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Fwhat-is-csrf-attack-cyber-attack%2F&amp;linkname=What%20is%20CSRF%20Attack%3F%20%E2%80%93%20Cyber%20Attack\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Reddit\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_pinterest\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/pinterest?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Fwhat-is-csrf-attack-cyber-attack%2F&amp;linkname=What%20is%20CSRF%20Attack%3F%20%E2%80%93%20Cyber%20Attack\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pinterest\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_counter addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Fwhat-is-csrf-attack-cyber-attack%2F&#038;title=What%20is%20CSRF%20Attack%3F%20%E2%80%93%20Cyber%20Attack\"><\/a><\/p>"

On the other hand, this kind of process needs a huge amount of storage capacity (Terabytes), which is not very difficult to find nowadays.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>How does Rainbow Table Attack Work<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The main functionality behind Rainbow Tables is the ability to perform cryptanalysis rapidly and effectively, also known as <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/topics\/computer-science\/cryptographic-algorithm#:~:text=Cryptographic%20algorithms%20are%20used%20for,to%20machine%20or%20user%20identities.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" style=\"color: #0000ff;\" target=\"_blank\">crypto-algorithms<\/a><\/span>. Below we will analyze the most common types:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Direct Mapping:<\/strong> In this method, hash functions map plaintexts to hashes so that you can&#8217;t find a plain text from its original hash, as described in the diagram.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-14940 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/ipwithease.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/rainbow-table-2.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Reduced Mapping:<\/strong> In this method, when you ask the hash of a plaintext, and take the reduction of the hash, the outcome will not give you the original plain text.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-14941 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/ipwithease.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/rainbow-table-3.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Crossway Mapping:<\/strong> In this method, chains in a rainbow table start with an arbitrary plain text, then it hashes and reduces the hash to another plain text. The Rainbow Table stores the starting plain text, and the final hash end with millions of hashes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-14942 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/ipwithease.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/rainbow-table-4.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Advantages and Disadvantages of Rainbow Table Attacks<\/strong><\/h2>\n<h3>Advantages:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Hacker attacks using Rainbow Tables have the advantage of most data being pre-computed, resulting in an easy hack access. Therefore the whole process is just a simple search and compare operation on the table unlike the Brute Force Attacks.<\/li>\n<li>Another crucial advantage using of Rainbow Tables is the ability of authentication without serious obstacles. This occurs because the exact password string does not have to be known or estimated. If a hash match occurs, then it is enough for the attack to be performed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>Disadvantages:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>One main and most common problem when dealing with Rainbow Table Attacks is the fact that these tables need to be stored in a huge memory (Hard Disks). Sometimes Terabytes are needed, resulting in an increased maintenance cost.<\/li>\n<li>Another disadvantage of Rainbow Tables is the fact that If the hash the hacker is trying to break is not in his table, then he will be unable to find the resultant password in a short period of time. This gives the limitation of the table in use.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-14943 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/ipwithease.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/rainbow-table-5.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Mitigation from Rainbow Table Attacks<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Cybersecurity community has addressed the Rainbow Table attacks all these years and have invented very effective ways of dealing with them. Some of the most effective and widely preferred methods are enlisted as under:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Salt Technique:<\/strong> The most commonly used method to prevent a Rainbow Table Attack nowadays is called <strong>\u201cSalt\u201d<\/strong>. In this method random data are passed in to the hash function along with the plain text. The result of this method is the creation of a unique hash for every password preventing duplicated values.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Key Stretching:<\/strong> This is another very effective method to prevent a Rainbow Table Attack and is used against hackers. The main concept of this method is to insert intermediate hash key values in between the plain text and the password, in order to increase the computation time required by the attack. The result is the obvious time expiration and failure of the attack.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>Conclusion\u00a0<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><strong>Rainbow Table Attack<\/strong> is used from hackers nowadays for the main advantage of an extremely high speed technique to crack passwords. In minimum time, security Scientists have addressed this hacking activity and invented sophisticated techniques to resolve it, the most well-known is <strong>\u201cSalt\u201d and \u201cKey Stretching\u201d<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Unlike other techniques, huge storage is needed for Rainbow Table Attacks and sadly the decreasing price per <strong>Mbyte<\/strong> for storage solutions nowadays doesn\u2019t help our safety. In order to avoid being a victim of Rainbow Table Attack, it is strongly advised to perform frequent password changes.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\">Continue Reading:<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><em><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/ipwithease.com\/cyber-attacks-and-their-types\/\" style=\"color: #0000ff;\">Cyber Attacks and their types<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><em><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/ipwithease.com\/what-is-ddos-attack\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" style=\"color: #0000ff;\" target=\"_blank\">What is DDoS Attack?\u00a0<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Fintroduction-to-rainbow-table-cyber-attack%2F&amp;linkname=Introduction%20to%20Rainbow%20Table%20%3A%20Cyber%20Attack\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Facebook\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Fintroduction-to-rainbow-table-cyber-attack%2F&amp;linkname=Introduction%20to%20Rainbow%20Table%20%3A%20Cyber%20Attack\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Twitter\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_linkedin\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Fintroduction-to-rainbow-table-cyber-attack%2F&amp;linkname=Introduction%20to%20Rainbow%20Table%20%3A%20Cyber%20Attack\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"LinkedIn\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_whatsapp\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/whatsapp?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Fintroduction-to-rainbow-table-cyber-attack%2F&amp;linkname=Introduction%20to%20Rainbow%20Table%20%3A%20Cyber%20Attack\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"WhatsApp\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_email\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Fintroduction-to-rainbow-table-cyber-attack%2F&amp;linkname=Introduction%20to%20Rainbow%20Table%20%3A%20Cyber%20Attack\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Email\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_reddit\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Fintroduction-to-rainbow-table-cyber-attack%2F&amp;linkname=Introduction%20to%20Rainbow%20Table%20%3A%20Cyber%20Attack\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Reddit\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_pinterest\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/pinterest?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Fintroduction-to-rainbow-table-cyber-attack%2F&amp;linkname=Introduction%20to%20Rainbow%20Table%20%3A%20Cyber%20Attack\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pinterest\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_counter addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Fintroduction-to-rainbow-table-cyber-attack%2F&#038;title=Introduction%20to%20Rainbow%20Table%20%3A%20Cyber%20Attack\"><\/a><\/p>"

This opens up many avenues for implementing position tracking to increase the efficiency of a business in industries such as retail, warehousing, manufacturing, healthcare, and more.<\/p>\n<p>The use of these<strong> indoor navigation applications<\/strong> has been so widespread. It has penetrated so many new markets that, at its current rate of expansion, it is expected to reach a growth rate of 30.50% in the coming years (based on this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketresearchfuture.com\/reports\/indoor-positioning-navigation-system-market-1775\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">market research<\/span><\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>Forecasts also show the value of the market is set to be at around $24 billion by 2023, which is a massive jump from the base years\u2019 stats (2017), which was close to $7 billion.<\/p>\n<h2>How will this system affect the future of business?<\/h2>\n<p>As more people identify with the system, the more uses and expectations will spring out of it. GPS has been a worldwide phenomenon for a long time, and the way it has been used and integrated into other systems and technologies has revolutionized the world and the way we work.<\/p>\n<p>However, GPS is only able to work up to a certain extent and where they fail is when you\u2019re inside or in locations that satellite signals cannot penetrate through (even through walls and ceilings of buildings).<\/p>\n<p>Using a system of battery-based beacons that are placed inside buildings and Bluetooth, we can remove this limitation and get an accurate picture through the signals that these beacons receive. The innovations that are being made to these internal navigation systems are indicative of the revolutionary methods used by GPS at its time.<\/p>\n<p>To put it into context, let\u2019s look at some everyday situations in business and in life and how it can be affected:<\/p>\n<h2>General Life in 2021 \u2013 The Challenges<\/h2>\n<h3><strong>Traveling &#8211;\u00a0\u00a0<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>GPS has been known to fail in remote and underground locations meaning that you could potentially be lost in a place you don\u2019t know. However, Navigine has created a solution for this where they use <a href=\"https:\/\/navigine.com\/industries\/vehicles\/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">aided navigation<\/span><\/a> to get reliable positioning in even the most remote locations.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Business &#8211;<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><strong>Manufacturing\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Running a massive manufacturing operation is not easy and involves managing hundreds of staff, vehicles, and building space. Doing all this without investing in multiple expensively complex systems can be a danger to their staff\u2019s health and the costs of running the business.<\/p>\n<p>Suppose this is all brought into one system and you are able to utilize tracking systems on vehicles and other assets while also using real-time analytics and motion systems.<\/p>\n<p>In that case, the process will be highly centralized and will make it easy to monitor efficiency and safety standards. Navigine has already created this solution using its <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/navigine.com\/platform\/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" style=\"color: #0000ff;\" target=\"_blank\">indoor positioning system<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Advertising\u00a0 &#8211;\u00a0<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>We can all agree that advertising has the potential to change the world because of the impact it has had on global causes over the past decades. Using this location-based technology, businesses will be able to appeal to different audiences using targeted campaigns aimed at each of these audiences rather than one campaign aimed at their whole market.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>How Covid-19 has affected businesses<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The pandemic raging these days has become a crucial factor that every business in the world has been affected by in some way. It has created many new challenges that businesses were not prepared for and we are seeing whole new methods of innovation being brought in to combat these changes.<\/p>\n<p>The new normal that we see these days is the need for social distancing between people. Internal locations such as warehouses and offices are more susceptible to spreading the virus because of the way they work.<\/p>\n<p>This is why there is an increasing need for new technology that is able to monitor contact between workers and also conduct contact tracing to stem the spread of the virus as much as possible.<\/p>\n<p>As it currently stands, the world still needs to continue its operations even though this brings up many complications. When an employee is found to be Covid positive, the current method of dealing with it is to halt all operations, isolate all the other employees, and place everyone in quarantine. This is a highly impractical method and involves a high cost.<\/p>\n<p>With the application of <strong>indoor positioning systems<\/strong>, we can get a clear and precise view of everything that happened inside that location. Contact tracing will be much easier to keep track of because this system can consistently track people working in that area using the multiple Bluetooth and beacon technologies placed inside these areas.<\/p>\n<p>The worker who had the virus could then be tracked and this information will tell us where this person had visited over the past few days and the areas that they were most active in. Quick action can be taken to disinfect these areas, identify potential leaks, and get a list of co-workers with who they would have come in contact.<\/p>\n<p>These systems will be crucial to stemming the spread of the virus and will make the whole process of identifying and keeping tracking of Covid-19 patients worldwide so much simpler. Hospitals that incorporate this <strong>patient tracking system<\/strong> will be able to use the information to curb the virus from spreading.<\/p>\n<p>There is only so much we can do to prevent the virus from wreaking havoc globally and the implementation of these systems can do wonders to keep the virus in check.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\"><strong>Related:<\/strong><\/span> <em><strong><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/ipwithease.com\/challenges-ahead-coronavirus-impact-on-internet-service-providers\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" style=\"color: #0000ff;\" target=\"_blank\">Challenges Ahead: Coronavirus Impact<\/a><\/span><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<h2><em>Here is how internal positioning will affect businesses this year. <\/em><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><strong>1.Retail<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Implementing <strong>indoor navigation<\/strong> into retail stores and malls can do a lot for both businesses and customers alike. Companies can lead customers straight to the products they are looking for using this system. You can even utilize geo-location inside a mall to notify customers about a sale or deal when they are close to the store.<\/p>\n<p>Because of how fast-paced the retail industry is &#8211; and with giants like Amazon creating intense online competition &#8211; many retail businesses are always on the lookout for new ways to improve the customer experience and increase sales. That is where internal <strong>navigation software<\/strong> comes into play with their advanced location systems and notifications that are going to save both the business and the customer money and time.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2.Industry<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The manufacturing side of business is also seeing a boom in innovative technology that saves time and cost. Currently, large factories require a lot of staff working and supervising to keep running smoothly. There is a lot that needs to be kept track of, and it is very easy to lose track of what goes on inside big operations like these.<\/p>\n<p>With the introduction of real-time monitoring software, these businesses will be able to track the movement of all their staff and assets, which will, over time, make the whole process faster and smoother. This will boost productivity levels, help identify hidden costs that can usually get lost in massive spreadsheets, and help managers make more informed decisions in real-time.<\/p>\n<p>All this is only with the start of this new era in development. In 2021, especially with the way Covid-19 has hit this industry, these technologies will be adopted by many manufacturing businesses to help with their day-to-day work and, thus, will only improve over time.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3.Smart Offices<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-14949 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/ipwithease.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/INDOOR-POSITIONING-SYSTEM-AND-NAVIGATION-1.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The one thing that is most prominent about the way we work now because of the virus is that most businesses have switched to remote working. Companies have woken up to the fact that technology can be incorporated into how their staff work to increase convenience and, thereby, productivity.<\/p>\n<p>As such, there has been more talk about incorporating more of this technology into regular offices because of the success we have seen so far. This technology can be used to monitor real-time data inside offices, such as meeting room availability, cloud-based security, booking software, and more.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4.Logistics<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>Logistics may look like an easy job from a description of it of but that in reality, that is far from the case. Everything from identifying packages to delivering them to the correct location can be a huge process depending on the company\u2019s size.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without software or technology in place, this method can take days or weeks, severely underutilizing the efficiency needed. We still need further improvements to processes to make shopping simpler in an increasingly digital era. The focus remains to minimize supply chain disruptions.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Understanding the Changes <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Indoor positioning systems provide real-time statistics and help in boosting productivity in various categories of business. Business owners can use this data &#8211; such as in retail sectors to attract customers and increase sales.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With time, more businesses will adjust to incorporate these new technologies, such as vehicles that can use the location system to navigate around warehouses by themselves to deliver boxes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>In 2021, <strong>navigation software<\/strong> like this may start to get adopted faster by companies than ever done previously.<\/p>\n<p>If anything, Covid-19 has proven that humans can adapt to many situations even if they have never seen them before.<\/p>\n<p>We all need to do our part in curbing this virus and the use of <strong>indoor navigation applications<\/strong> is certainly going to be a very important step in helping with this. Now, it has many uses and applications that it can certainly help with. That being said, it is now more important than ever to introduce an internal navigation and positioning system to help the world fight against Covid-19.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Findoor-positioning-and-navigation%2F&amp;linkname=How%20will%20Indoor%20Positioning%20and%20Navigation%20Help%20Industries%20Grow%20in%202021%3F\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Facebook\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Findoor-positioning-and-navigation%2F&amp;linkname=How%20will%20Indoor%20Positioning%20and%20Navigation%20Help%20Industries%20Grow%20in%202021%3F\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Twitter\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_linkedin\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Findoor-positioning-and-navigation%2F&amp;linkname=How%20will%20Indoor%20Positioning%20and%20Navigation%20Help%20Industries%20Grow%20in%202021%3F\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"LinkedIn\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_whatsapp\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/whatsapp?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Findoor-positioning-and-navigation%2F&amp;linkname=How%20will%20Indoor%20Positioning%20and%20Navigation%20Help%20Industries%20Grow%20in%202021%3F\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"WhatsApp\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_email\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Findoor-positioning-and-navigation%2F&amp;linkname=How%20will%20Indoor%20Positioning%20and%20Navigation%20Help%20Industries%20Grow%20in%202021%3F\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Email\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_reddit\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Findoor-positioning-and-navigation%2F&amp;linkname=How%20will%20Indoor%20Positioning%20and%20Navigation%20Help%20Industries%20Grow%20in%202021%3F\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Reddit\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_pinterest\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/pinterest?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Findoor-positioning-and-navigation%2F&amp;linkname=How%20will%20Indoor%20Positioning%20and%20Navigation%20Help%20Industries%20Grow%20in%202021%3F\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pinterest\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_counter addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Findoor-positioning-and-navigation%2F&#038;title=How%20will%20Indoor%20Positioning%20and%20Navigation%20Help%20Industries%20Grow%20in%202021%3F\"><\/a><\/p>"

I plan on using <a href=\"https:\/\/www.submarinecablemap.com\/#\/\">https:\/\/www.submarinecablemap.com\/#\/<\/a> to get the shortest cable lengths from Australia &lt;-&gt; US (West) and using them. *I am by no means suggesting Telstra Endeavour &amp; SEA-US are the lowest latency cables AU &lt;-&gt; US it was just a random example*<\/p> <p>&#x200b;<\/p> <p>TLDR; Do providers (Cogent, HE, etc) provide Continent &lt;-&gt; Continent solutions where you can specify the subsea cable used?<\/p> <\/div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/Ozot-The-Esports-ISP\"> \/u\/Ozot-The-Esports-ISP <\/a> <br \/> <span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/networking\/comments\/ldv0hl\/australia_us_l2l3_subsea_cable_options\/\">[link]<\/a><\/span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/networking\/comments\/ldv0hl\/australia_us_l2l3_subsea_cable_options\/\">[comments]<\/a><\/span>"

Karma).<\/p> <p>Housecleaning done, my question is: ignoring the questionable architecture, the occasional instability, the slow and dated GUI, the cost, and the painful upgrade process, does FTD actually have the potential of being a solid and competitive platform for NGFW\/IPS?<\/p> <p>Based on the several books I have been reading and the online courses I attended, FTD seems to be a pretty capable platform, overall. I do wonder if the capabilities and the potential are overshadowed by the many horrendous limitations I listed above. <\/p> <p>Thanks. I welcome your thoughts.<\/p> <\/div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/spidernik84\"> \/u\/spidernik84 <\/a> <br \/> <span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/networking\/comments\/ldwke9\/firepower_how_does_it_compare_to_the_competition\/\">[link]<\/a><\/span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/networking\/comments\/ldwke9\/firepower_how_does_it_compare_to_the_competition\/\">[comments]<\/a><\/span>"

We decided to do it this way since it would allow our site techs, who don\u2019t have access to switch port configurations, to easily connect APs, VoIP, etc. This has, however, led to extremely messy network cabinets with wires crossing over each other. We want to work on cleaning this up soon so that it makes things neater and easier to manage.

Rapid integration of different endpoint devices and operating systems can be possible if the endpoint solution is able to support the merged organization\u2019s ecosystem of partner technologies quickly and easily.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"background: white;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"><b><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">Taking the messiness out of mergers<\/span><\/span><\/b><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"background: white;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">Integrating technology from often somewhat disparate entities can occur without extreme disruption. By beginning with a solid knowledge base of all assets involved and putting into place an inherently secure endpoint operating system, organizations will benefit from easy endpoint management and control. This will also support a modern virtualized environment, deliver a superb user experience, and offer hardware platform independence so that IT and HR can proceed with a merger knowing they have a solid, standardized, well-functioning foundation that can economically support future advancements in the delivery of cloud workspaces.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6.0pt; margin-left: 0in;\"><span style=\"background: white;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"><i><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: #222222;\">Dan O\u2019Farrell is senior director, product marketing at <\/span><\/span><\/i><span style=\"color: black;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.igel.com\/\" target=\"_blank\"><i><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: #1155cc;\">IGEL<\/span><\/span><\/i><\/a><\/span><i><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: #222222;\">.<\/span><\/span><\/i><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>"

First, we don't have a sufficient broadband infrastructure in the U.S., particularly in less populated and lower-income areas.

Connecting its local fiber build-out can be done via a telecom carrier hotel, but these are often located far outside smaller local communities. So even where fiber is laid in these rural areas, there are significant challenges to connect back to the internet.\u00a0 <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">Ultimately, as most things often do, the issue boils down to economics. Low population density means a larger area to cover, and thus, high capital costs. With fewer potential subscribers reached by a fiber rollout, the build-out infrastructure price per subscriber is also much higher, often making the ROI too low to implement without government or state subsidies. But despite various subsidy programs over the years, the problem persists. Often, subsidies have been given to the incumbent providers who have under-supplied these areas.

Over the past five years, we've seen massive digital advancements move from the ideation through the conversation stage and finally toward actual implementation. Edge computing is one of these technologies. While not necessarily new, we\u2019re just now starting to see how edge computing \u2013 the move from centralized data centers or cloud areas to more distributed computing that's closer to the source of the data \u2013 is becoming a key tool for certain industries. And rightfully so. Edge computing has the power to dramatically accelerate innovation in these sectors. But for organizations to experience the full benefits of the edge, they\u2019ll need to understand the role advanced technologies like 5G and artificial intelligence (AI) play in introducing disruptive new use cases. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\" xml:lang=\"EN\"><span>5G is the next-generation iteration of mobile communications that will allow much lower latency and higher throughput for wireless services, improving greatly on its predecessors. 5G is also ushering in other changes in mobile networks, including cloud-native software-driven components and open interfaces all of the way down to the radio network (RAN). All of this new technology comes with more complexity, but mobile operators can\u2019t afford to increase the cost of operating their networks to deal with this complexity. That\u2019s where AI comes in. AI is critical to the success of 5G and edge computing by enabling self-monitoring capabilities that ensure high quality and low latency of service. While neither of these technologies may be new to the business tech stack, they've never been more relevant or critical to what enterprises need right now. Here's how they'll affect each other and where we'll see the most impact: <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"background: white;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><b><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 14.0pt;\" xml:lang=\"EN\"><span><span style=\"color: black;\">The impact of AI on 5G <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/b><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"background: white;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\" xml:lang=\"EN\"><span><span style=\"color: black;\">The future possibilities for AI application developers and 5G service providers are growing \u2013 especially when the two technologies are leveraged together. On its own, 5G\u2019s capabilities allow for increased speeds; however, when combined with AI, entirely new opportunities are opened up. AI-based applications can react in near real-time to data being generated from 5G networks, giving way to an entirely new frontier of possibilities for automation. And for 5G, the automated capabilities of AI are critical. 5G networks are more complex than their predecessors and need consistent monitoring to ensure they are functioning at optimal levels. This observance cannot be completely owned by humans, as it requires around the clock management to guarantee the network is optimized and running well. Leveraging AI for automated monitoring capabilities does just that, helping to manage not only 5G networks but also control cost; as such, many service providers will adopt AI to build networks that can self-manage and self-heal.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"background: white;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><b><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 14.0pt;\" xml:lang=\"EN\"><span><span style=\"color: black;\">The impact of 5G on AI <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/b><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"background: white;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\" xml:lang=\"EN\"><span><span style=\"color: black;\">5G\u2019s capabilities to provide higher bandwidth and lower latency open up many new opportunities for AI applications. For example, think about the AI-powered voice assistant. When a user asks Siri or Alexa a question, there is a small lag in the response due to the technology\u2019s need to travel to the cloud center to process the request and identify the answer. This short delay might be fine when asking casual questions. What the weather is, who won last night\u2019s baseball game, or otherwise? But these seconds can be critical in more urgent cases that require a response in milliseconds. When combined with the capabilities of 5G networks, AI applications will be able to work smarter, faster. We'll see this create new opportunities in vital industries like healthcare or in the military and also provide enhanced experiences in consumer-facing sectors like retail and gaming. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"background: white;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><b><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 14.0pt;\" xml:lang=\"EN\"><span><span style=\"color: black;\">Where will we see this play out?<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/b><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"background: white;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\" xml:lang=\"EN\"><span><span style=\"color: black;\">Industries that adopt 5G and AI will change drastically, enabling new opportunities that can be leveraged as a competitive differentiator. Manufacturing is one that elicits the most promise in terms of being transformed by advanced tech. The sector is on track toward being completely automated, leveraging AI to ensure it\u2019s acting and reacting intelligently, without human intervention. But it will also need 5G; not only for the reduced latency requirements but also to facilitate edge computing adoption. Edge computing usage in manufacturing will allow the necessary data being disseminated across the network to live as close to each machine as possible so that it's being accurately relayed in real time. Industrial equipment will be able to work intelligently and autonomously, with the ultimate goal of all aspects of production being managed autonomously. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"background: white;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\" xml:lang=\"EN\"><span><span style=\"color: black;\">On the less critical side, 5G and AI will allow for enhanced experiences for gamers. Gamers are a committed group, and every millisecond of latency can alter or ruin their experience, especially as technologies such as augmented reality are introduced.

Here's how they'll affect each other and where we'll see the most impact: <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"background: white;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><b><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 14.0pt;\" xml:lang=\"EN\"><span><span style=\"color: black;\">The impact of AI on 5G <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/b><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"background: white;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\" xml:lang=\"EN\"><span><span style=\"color: black;\">The future possibilities for AI application developers and 5G service providers are growing \u2013 especially when the two technologies are leveraged together. On its own, 5G\u2019s capabilities allow for increased speeds; however, when combined with AI, entirely new opportunities are opened up. AI-based applications can react in near real-time to data being generated from 5G networks, giving way to an entirely new frontier of possibilities for automation. And for 5G, the automated capabilities of AI are critical. 5G networks are more complex than their predecessors and need consistent monitoring to ensure they are functioning at optimal levels. This observance cannot be completely owned by humans, as it requires around the clock management to guarantee the network is optimized and running well. Leveraging AI for automated monitoring capabilities does just that, helping to manage not only 5G networks but also control cost; as such, many service providers will adopt AI to build networks that can self-manage and self-heal.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"background: white;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><b><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 14.0pt;\" xml:lang=\"EN\"><span><span style=\"color: black;\">The impact of 5G on AI <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/b><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"background: white;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\" xml:lang=\"EN\"><span><span style=\"color: black;\">5G\u2019s capabilities to provide higher bandwidth and lower latency open up many new opportunities for AI applications. For example, think about the AI-powered voice assistant. When a user asks Siri or Alexa a question, there is a small lag in the response due to the technology\u2019s need to travel to the cloud center to process the request and identify the answer. This short delay might be fine when asking casual questions. What the weather is, who won last night\u2019s baseball game, or otherwise? But these seconds can be critical in more urgent cases that require a response in milliseconds. When combined with the capabilities of 5G networks, AI applications will be able to work smarter, faster. We'll see this create new opportunities in vital industries like healthcare or in the military and also provide enhanced experiences in consumer-facing sectors like retail and gaming. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"background: white;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><b><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 14.0pt;\" xml:lang=\"EN\"><span><span style=\"color: black;\">Where will we see this play out?<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/b><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"background: white;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\" xml:lang=\"EN\"><span><span style=\"color: black;\">Industries that adopt 5G and AI will change drastically, enabling new opportunities that can be leveraged as a competitive differentiator. Manufacturing is one that elicits the most promise in terms of being transformed by advanced tech. The sector is on track toward being completely automated, leveraging AI to ensure it\u2019s acting and reacting intelligently, without human intervention. But it will also need 5G; not only for the reduced latency requirements but also to facilitate edge computing adoption. Edge computing usage in manufacturing will allow the necessary data being disseminated across the network to live as close to each machine as possible so that it's being accurately relayed in real time. Industrial equipment will be able to work intelligently and autonomously, with the ultimate goal of all aspects of production being managed autonomously. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"background: white;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\" xml:lang=\"EN\"><span><span style=\"color: black;\">On the less critical side, 5G and AI will allow for enhanced experiences for gamers. Gamers are a committed group, and every millisecond of latency can alter or ruin their experience, especially as technologies such as augmented reality are introduced. They need the advanced speed and connectivity that 5G can provide and the ability for the self-management of the network that AI drives. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"background: white;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\" xml:lang=\"EN\"><span><span style=\"color: black;\">The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has forced enterprises to recalibrate and reconsider every aspect of business and how they're managing product development, which innovation strategies are successful, and what tools to incorporate into their tech stacks. With the economy in flux and the marketplace growing increasingly competitive, enterprises need to strongly consider how they\u2019ll gain an edge as they navigate the new normal. Now is the right time to adopt the new technologies that will completely transform our industries. Edge computing, fueled by 5G and AI adoption, is the right technology for this moment and beyond. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><em>Tom Foottit is VP of Product Management at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.accedian.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Accedian<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>"

on VRF and I can't figure out how to set the mgmt interface into a specific VRF.\nI suppose is it through a statement like:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>   vrf definition management rd 10.12.15.73:0\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>but it doesn't work and I don't understand how the \"rd\" part works.<\/p>\n\n<p>The switch is a MSN2700 with MLNX-OS version 3.6.3508.\nThe switch current

When upgrading from a fairly old to a newer PAN-OS version, multi-step upgrades might be necessary. This ensures the device\u2019s configuration is migrated to the PAN-OS's newer supported features and that nothing \u201cbreaks\u201d during the upgrade process.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Like most vendors, Palo Alto Networks produce a <strong>base image<\/strong> and <strong>maintenance releases. Maintenance releases<\/strong> are small upgrades of the <strong>base image<\/strong> and deal with <strong>bug fixes<\/strong> and sometimes introduce small enhancements.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As a rule of thumb, firewalls should be running the Palo Alto <a href=\"https:\/\/live.paloaltonetworks.com\/t5\/customer-resources\/support-pan-os-software-release-guidance\/ta-p\/258304\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">preferred PAN-OS release<\/a>, and it is generally a good practice to install these releases as they are published.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When upgrading your PAN-OS to the <strong>latest maintenance release<\/strong> of a <strong>newer base release<\/strong>, the firewall <strong>will likely require<\/strong> you to <strong>download the new base release<\/strong> before allowing you to install its <strong>latest maintenance release<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For example, our firewall is currently running version <strong>9.0.3-h3<\/strong>, noted by the \u2018<strong>tick<\/strong>\u2019 on the <strong>Currently Installed<\/strong> column, and our goal is to upgrade to version <strong>9.1.4 (preferred release)<\/strong> as shown below:<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"Palo Alto PAN-OS upgrade path\" src=\"http:\/\/www.firewall.cx\/images\/stories\/palo-alto-firewalls\/firewall-pan-os-upgrade-standalone\/pan-os-upgrade-path.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Palo Alto PAN-OS upgrade path\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When attempting to <strong>download version 9.1.4<\/strong>, a<strong> maintenance release for base 9.1.0<\/strong>, we received an error (see screenshot below) explaining that we need to <strong>download<\/strong> <strong>9.1.0 base image<\/strong> first (no installation required).

When upgrading from a fairly old to a newer PAN-OS version, multi-step upgrades might be necessary. This ensures the device\u2019s configuration is migrated to the PAN-OS's newer supported features and that nothing \u201cbreaks\u201d during the upgrade process.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Like most vendors, Palo Alto Networks produce a <strong>base image<\/strong> and <strong>maintenance releases. Maintenance releases<\/strong> are small upgrades of the <strong>base image<\/strong> and deal with <strong>bug fixes<\/strong> and sometimes introduce small enhancements.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As a rule of thumb, firewalls should be running the Palo Alto <a href=\"https:\/\/live.paloaltonetworks.com\/t5\/customer-resources\/support-pan-os-software-release-guidance\/ta-p\/258304\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">preferred PAN-OS release<\/a>, and it is generally a good practice to install these releases as they are published.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When upgrading your PAN-OS to the <strong>latest maintenance release<\/strong> of a <strong>newer base release<\/strong>, the firewall <strong>will likely require<\/strong> you to <strong>download the new base release<\/strong> before allowing you to install its <strong>latest maintenance release<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For example, our firewall is currently running version <strong>9.0.3-h3<\/strong>, noted by the \u2018<strong>tick<\/strong>\u2019 on the <strong>Currently Installed<\/strong> column, and our goal is to upgrade to version <strong>9.1.4 (preferred release)<\/strong> as shown below:<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"Palo Alto PAN-OS upgrade path\" src=\"http:\/\/www.firewall.cx\/images\/stories\/palo-alto-firewalls\/firewall-pan-os-upgrade-standalone\/pan-os-upgrade-path.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Palo Alto PAN-OS upgrade path\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When attempting to <strong>download version 9.1.4<\/strong>, a<strong> maintenance release for base 9.1.0<\/strong>, we received an error (see screenshot below) explaining that we need to <strong>download<\/strong> <strong>9.1.0 base image<\/strong> first (no installation required).

As we wrap up our look at advanced OSPF topics, we'll discuss default routes, and compare OSPFv2 with OSPFv3.<\/p>\n<h2>Default Routes<\/h2>\n<p>We have seen where OSPF can automatically generate a default route when needed. This occurs with some of our special area types. For example, of you configure a totally stubby area, of course a default route is required and OSPF generates this route automatically from the ABR.<\/p>\n<p>In order to increase flexibility with your designs, default routes injected into a normal area can be originated by any OSPF router. To generate a default route, you use the <strong>default-information originate&nbsp;<\/strong>command.<\/p>\n<p>This command presents two options:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can advertise 0.0.0.0 into the OSPF domain, provided the advertising router already has a default route.<\/li>\n<li>You can advertise 0.0.0.0 regardless of whether the advertising router already has a default route.

This is the job of OSPFv3. The great news for you is the fact that you can leverage almost everything you have learned about OSPFv2 when transitioning to the OSPFv3 protocol. There was not a complete redesign of the protocol, and as much functionality and configuration steps were maintained as possible.<\/p>\n<p>As you will learn in this section, OSPFv3 offers the use of address families in the configuration, making this protocol suited for carrying IPv6 prefixes, or even IPv4 prefixes with the appropriate address family.<\/p>\n<p>For the sake of completion, this section demonstrates the &ldquo;standard&rdquo; configuration of OSPFv3, as well as the address family configuration.<\/p>\n<p>It is fun, and important, to distinguish the key similarities and differences between v2 and v3 of the OSPF protocols.&nbsp;Here are the similarities that jump off the page:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>In OSPFv3, a routing process does not need to be explicitly created. Enabling OSPFv3 on an interface will cause a routing process and its associated configuration to be created.<\/li>\n<li>The router ID is still a 32-bit value in OSPFv3 and the process of router ID selection is the same. OSPF automatically prefers a loopback interface over any other kind, and it chooses the highest IP address among all loopback interfaces. If no loopback interfaces are present, the highest IP address in the device is chosen.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Here are some key differences:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>In OSPFv3, each interface must be enabled using commands in interface configuration mode. This feature is different from OSPF version 2, in which interfaces are indirectly enabled using the device configuration mode.<\/li>\n<li>When using a nonbroadcast multiaccess interface in OSPFv3, you must manually configure the device with the list of neighbors. Neighboring devices are identified by their device ID.<\/li>\n<li>In IPv6, you can configure many address prefixes on an interface. In OSPFv3, all address prefixes on an interface are included by default. You cannot select some address prefixes to be imported into OSPFv3; either all address prefixes on an interface are imported, or no address prefixes on an interface are imported.<\/li>\n<li>Unlike OSPF version 2, multiple instances of OSPFv3 can be run on a link.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Traditional OSPFv3 Configuration<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In order to demonstrate (and practice) the OSPFv3 configuration, lets drop such a topology in right alongside the existing IPv4 topology that we have.<\/p>\n<p>Here is the configuration of our backbone area (Area 0) and non-backbone area (Area 1) using the &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; OSPFv3 approach.<\/p>\n<p><img height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net\/kajabi-storefronts-production\/blogs\/3184\/images\/Lw0jVLD3RMSOjg66CTQA_Screen_Shot_2019-07-08_at_2.58.32_PM.png\" width=\"603\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Note how familiar this configuration approach seems, especially if you are a fan of the interface-level approach to configuring OSPFv2. Notice also, we must globally enable the IPv6 unicast routing capability on the device. This is not a default behavior. You should also note that this is not required in order to run IPv6 on interfaces, it is simply a requirement to do routing of IPv6 traffic on the router.<\/p>\n<p>Here is the configuration of our two other devices:<\/p>\n<p><img height=\"385\" src=\"https:\/\/kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net\/kajabi-storefronts-production\/blogs\/3184\/images\/qhfT0TapS1mko8aknJQ8_Screen_Shot_2019-07-08_at_2.59.41_PM.png\" width=\"603\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img height=\"204\" src=\"https:\/\/kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net\/kajabi-storefronts-production\/blogs\/3184\/images\/Q6mnUKM1RUSPRd9HDLBt_Screen_Shot_2019-07-08_at_3.00.26_PM.png\" width=\"603\" \/><\/p>\n<p>It is now time for some verification. Note that I will perform all of these on the ORL device for brevity.

Also note that your approach to configuring OSPFv3 under interfaces does not change.<\/p>\n<p>That wraps up our look at some advanced OSPF concepts. Until next time, take good care.<\/p>",

Enabling OSPFv3 on an interface will cause a routing process and its associated configuration to be created.<\/li>\n<li>The router ID is still a 32-bit value in OSPFv3 and the process of router ID selection is the same. OSPF automatically prefers a loopback interface over any other kind, and it chooses the highest IP address among all loopback interfaces. If no loopback interfaces are present, the highest IP address in the device is chosen.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Here are some key differences:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>In OSPFv3, each interface must be enabled using commands in interface configuration mode. This feature is different from OSPF version 2, in which interfaces are indirectly enabled using the device configuration mode.<\/li>\n<li>When using a nonbroadcast multiaccess interface in OSPFv3, you must manually configure the device with the list of neighbors. Neighboring devices are identified by their device ID.<\/li>\n<li>In IPv6, you can configure many address prefixes on an interface. In OSPFv3, all address prefixes on an interface are included by default. You cannot select some address prefixes to be imported into OSPFv3; either all address prefixes on an interface are imported, or no address prefixes on an interface are imported.<\/li>\n<li>Unlike OSPF version 2, multiple instances of OSPFv3 can be run on a link.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Traditional OSPFv3 Configuration<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In order to demonstrate (and practice) the OSPFv3 configuration, lets drop such a topology in right alongside the existing IPv4 topology that we have.<\/p>\n<p>Here is the configuration of our backbone area (Area 0) and non-backbone area (Area 1) using the &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; OSPFv3 approach.<\/p>\n<p><img height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net\/kajabi-storefronts-production\/blogs\/3184\/images\/Lw0jVLD3RMSOjg66CTQA_Screen_Shot_2019-07-08_at_2.58.32_PM.png\" width=\"603\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Note how familiar this configuration approach seems, especially if you are a fan of the interface-level approach to configuring OSPFv2. Notice also, we must globally enable the IPv6 unicast routing capability on the device. This is not a default behavior. You should also note that this is not required in order to run IPv6 on interfaces, it is simply a requirement to do routing of IPv6 traffic on the router.<\/p>\n<p>Here is the configuration of our two other devices:<\/p>\n<p><img height=\"385\" src=\"https:\/\/kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net\/kajabi-storefronts-production\/blogs\/3184\/images\/qhfT0TapS1mko8aknJQ8_Screen_Shot_2019-07-08_at_2.59.41_PM.png\" width=\"603\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img height=\"204\" src=\"https:\/\/kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net\/kajabi-storefronts-production\/blogs\/3184\/images\/Q6mnUKM1RUSPRd9HDLBt_Screen_Shot_2019-07-08_at_3.00.26_PM.png\" width=\"603\" \/><\/p>\n<p>It is now time for some verification. Note that I will perform all of these on the ORL device for brevity. Notice once again all the wonderful similarities to OSPFv2:<\/p>\n<p><img height=\"546\" src=\"https:\/\/kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net\/kajabi-storefronts-production\/blogs\/3184\/images\/2aAXhz3mTuKwPOR9ltT0_Screen_Shot_2019-07-08_at_3.02.06_PM.png\" width=\"602\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img height=\"160\" src=\"https:\/\/kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net\/kajabi-storefronts-production\/blogs\/3184\/images\/rSocRgBESLaWRnVxZXPQ_Screen_Shot_2019-07-08_at_3.02.42_PM.png\" width=\"601\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img height=\"648\" src=\"https:\/\/kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net\/kajabi-storefronts-production\/blogs\/3184\/images\/u2TDoeZPTjq7NYHV6JHX_Screen_Shot_2019-07-08_at_3.03.39_PM.png\" width=\"603\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>OSPFv3 Address Family Configuration<\/h2>\n<p>Let us conclude this chapter with a look at the address family configuration style of OPSFv3. Remember, this capability would permit us to use this single protocol for carrying both IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes.<\/p>\n<p>Here is an example of the OSPFv3 address family configuration approach:<\/p>\n<p><img height=\"206\" src=\"https:\/\/kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net\/kajabi-storefronts-production\/blogs\/3184\/images\/b8ZLX1E6StW3vZrx1jZk_Screen_Shot_2019-07-08_at_3.05.16_PM.png\" width=\"603\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Notice that if you are already familiar with address families from another protocol (such as BGP), this is a very simple configuration. Also note that your approach to configuring OSPFv3 under interfaces does not change.<\/p>\n<p>That wraps up our look at some advanced OSPF concepts. Until next time, take good care.<\/p>"

    "summary": "<p>The time has arrived to tackle some of the more advanced (and interesting) features of the Open Shortest Path First routing protocol. We begin by examining the configuration and verification of the different OSPF areas. This is an exercise that is not only fun, but it can really cement the knowledge down of how these areas function and why they exist.<\/p>\n<h2>OSPF LSA Types<\/h2>\n<p>Areas are a fundamental concept of OSPF. It is what makes the routing protocol, hierarchical, as we like to say.<\/p>\n<p>There is a core backbone area (Area 0) that connects to normal, non-backbone areas. The backbone might also connect to special area types we will examine in detail in this chapter. This hierarchical nature of the design helps ensure the protocol is very scalable. We can easily reduce or eliminate unnecessary routing traffic flows and communications between areas if needed. Database sizes are also contained using this approach.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Backbone and the Non-Backbone Areas<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>To review a bit from our previous blog posts, Figure 1 shows a simple multi-area network. Here I will configure this network using my personal favorite configuration approach, the interface-level configuration command <strong>ip ospf<\/strong>. Example 1 shows the configuration of all three devices.<\/p>\n<p><img height=\"168\" src=\"https:\/\/kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net\/kajabi-storefronts-production\/blogs\/3184\/images\/rFmVRW1KQjmhWCdpFyqx_Z-1.png\" width=\"603\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Figure 1: A backbone and non-backbone area<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Example 1: Configuring the Backbone and Non-Backbone Areas<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><img height=\"234\" src=\"https:\/\/kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net\/kajabi-storefronts-production\/blogs\/3184\/images\/tcJnOH8wQx2OAiW4Dgxy_Screen_Shot_2019-07-08_at_1.45.21_PM.png\" width=\"601\" \/><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><img height=\"311\" src=\"https:\/\/kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net\/kajabi-storefronts-production\/blogs\/3184\/images\/slCZAKeMTaWNDvivFRgC_Screen_Shot_2019-07-08_at_1.47.01_PM.png\" width=\"603\" \/><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><img height=\"235\" src=\"https:\/\/kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net\/kajabi-storefronts-production\/blogs\/3184\/images\/F3aQHubgREe3iTzbvrDg_Screen_Shot_2019-07-08_at_1.48.50_PM.png\" width=\"604\" \/><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Notice the simplicity of this configuration even though we are running a fairly complex routing protocol. The Area Border Router (ABR) is ATL2 with one interface in the backbone and one in the non-backbone area.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Notice also how we get some &ldquo;bonus&rdquo; verification free of charge. As we are configuring the interfaces, we can see OSPF adjacencies forming between the devices. This saves us from needing to verify these &ldquo;manually&rdquo; with the following command:<\/p>\n<p><img height=\"158\" src=\"https:\/\/kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net\/kajabi-storefronts-production\/blogs\/3184\/images\/QXxb5zTdTHm2x98GIeNZ_Screen_Shot_2019-07-08_at_1.50.16_PM.png\" width=\"601\" \/><\/p>\n<p>An interesting verification for us here is to check for the prefix of 1.1.1.0\/24 from the ATL device (as well as the remote link between ATL and ATL2). We check for this on ORL to verify the multi-area configuration of OSPF. Since this is a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; area, all LSAs should be permitted in the area and we should see the prefix appear as an inter-area OSPF route.<\/p>\n<p><img height=\"584\" src=\"https:\/\/kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net\/kajabi-storefronts-production\/blogs\/3184\/images\/4YgkVYCDSxydMInA45O9_Screen_Shot_2019-07-08_at_1.52.57_PM.png\" width=\"602\" \/><\/p>\n<p>While not often required in troubleshooting, we can examine the OSPF database in order to see the different types of LSAs in place.<\/p>\n<p><img height=\"431\" src=\"https:\/\/kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net\/kajabi-storefronts-production\/blogs\/3184\/images\/BGkb7RYGR5iumaGvmoUl_Screen_Shot_2019-07-08_at_1.53.55_PM.png\" width=\"602\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The router link state entries are the Type 1 LSAs. These are the endpoints in our local area of 1. The net link state entries are the Type 2 LSAs. Here we see the router ID of the Designated Router. Finally, the summary net link states are the Type 3 LSAs. These are the prefixes the ABR sends into our area. Sure enough, they are the loopback (1.1.1.0) and the remote network (10.12.12.0).<\/p>\n<p>NOTE: The loopback interface is advertised as a host route of 32-bit. To change this, you can just use the command <strong>ip ospf network point-to-point&nbsp;<\/strong>under the loopback interface. This changes the network type from the loopback type for OSPF and causes the mask to advertise as it is configured.<\/p>\n<p>Now it is time to add to the story here. Let&rsquo;s configure some external prefixes and inject them into the OSPF domain. This is simple thanks to loopback interfaces. We will create some on the ATL router, run EIGRP on them, and then redistribute them into OSPF.<\/p>\n<p><img height=\"335\" src=\"https:\/\/kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net\/kajabi-storefronts-production\/blogs\/3184\/images\/D8RfcruaRMWQtgzOjdvZ_Screen_Shot_2019-07-08_at_1.55.29_PM.png\" width=\"602\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Now we have even more interesting verifications on the ORL device.

      "value": "<p>The time has arrived to tackle some of the more advanced (and interesting) features of the Open Shortest Path First routing protocol. We begin by examining the configuration and verification of the different OSPF areas. This is an exercise that is not only fun, but it can really cement the knowledge down of how these areas function and why they exist.<\/p>\n<h2>OSPF LSA Types<\/h2>\n<p>Areas are a fundamental concept of OSPF. It is what makes the routing protocol, hierarchical, as we like to say.<\/p>\n<p>There is a core backbone area (Area 0) that connects to normal, non-backbone areas. The backbone might also connect to special area types we will examine in detail in this chapter. This hierarchical nature of the design helps ensure the protocol is very scalable. We can easily reduce or eliminate unnecessary routing traffic flows and communications between areas if needed. Database sizes are also contained using this approach.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Backbone and the Non-Backbone Areas<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>To review a bit from our previous blog posts, Figure 1 shows a simple multi-area network. Here I will configure this network using my personal favorite configuration approach, the interface-level configuration command <strong>ip ospf<\/strong>. Example 1 shows the configuration of all three devices.<\/p>\n<p><img height=\"168\" src=\"https:\/\/kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net\/kajabi-storefronts-production\/blogs\/3184\/images\/rFmVRW1KQjmhWCdpFyqx_Z-1.png\" width=\"603\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Figure 1: A backbone and non-backbone area<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Example 1: Configuring the Backbone and Non-Backbone Areas<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><img height=\"234\" src=\"https:\/\/kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net\/kajabi-storefronts-production\/blogs\/3184\/images\/tcJnOH8wQx2OAiW4Dgxy_Screen_Shot_2019-07-08_at_1.45.21_PM.png\" width=\"601\" \/><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><img height=\"311\" src=\"https:\/\/kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net\/kajabi-storefronts-production\/blogs\/3184\/images\/slCZAKeMTaWNDvivFRgC_Screen_Shot_2019-07-08_at_1.47.01_PM.png\" width=\"603\" \/><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><img height=\"235\" src=\"https:\/\/kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net\/kajabi-storefronts-production\/blogs\/3184\/images\/F3aQHubgREe3iTzbvrDg_Screen_Shot_2019-07-08_at_1.48.50_PM.png\" width=\"604\" \/><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Notice the simplicity of this configuration even though we are running a fairly complex routing protocol. The Area Border Router (ABR) is ATL2 with one interface in the backbone and one in the non-backbone area.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Notice also how we get some &ldquo;bonus&rdquo; verification free of charge. As we are configuring the interfaces, we can see OSPF adjacencies forming between the devices. This saves us from needing to verify these &ldquo;manually&rdquo; with the following command:<\/p>\n<p><img height=\"158\" src=\"https:\/\/kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net\/kajabi-storefronts-production\/blogs\/3184\/images\/QXxb5zTdTHm2x98GIeNZ_Screen_Shot_2019-07-08_at_1.50.16_PM.png\" width=\"601\" \/><\/p>\n<p>An interesting verification for us here is to check for the prefix of 1.1.1.0\/24 from the ATL device (as well as the remote link between ATL and ATL2). We check for this on ORL to verify the multi-area configuration of OSPF. Since this is a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; area, all LSAs should be permitted in the area and we should see the prefix appear as an inter-area OSPF route.<\/p>\n<p><img height=\"584\" src=\"https:\/\/kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net\/kajabi-storefronts-production\/blogs\/3184\/images\/4YgkVYCDSxydMInA45O9_Screen_Shot_2019-07-08_at_1.52.57_PM.png\" width=\"602\" \/><\/p>\n<p>While not often required in troubleshooting, we can examine the OSPF database in order to see the different types of LSAs in place.<\/p>\n<p><img height=\"431\" src=\"https:\/\/kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net\/kajabi-storefronts-production\/blogs\/3184\/images\/BGkb7RYGR5iumaGvmoUl_Screen_Shot_2019-07-08_at_1.53.55_PM.png\" width=\"602\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The router link state entries are the Type 1 LSAs. These are the endpoints in our local area of 1. The net link state entries are the Type 2 LSAs. Here we see the router ID of the Designated Router. Finally, the summary net link states are the Type 3 LSAs. These are the prefixes the ABR sends into our area. Sure enough, they are the loopback (1.1.1.0) and the remote network (10.12.12.0).<\/p>\n<p>NOTE: The loopback interface is advertised as a host route of 32-bit. To change this, you can just use the command <strong>ip ospf network point-to-point&nbsp;<\/strong>under the loopback interface. This changes the network type from the loopback type for OSPF and causes the mask to advertise as it is configured.<\/p>\n<p>Now it is time to add to the story here. Let&rsquo;s configure some external prefixes and inject them into the OSPF domain. This is simple thanks to loopback interfaces. We will create some on the ATL router, run EIGRP on them, and then redistribute them into OSPF.<\/p>\n<p><img height=\"335\" src=\"https:\/\/kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net\/kajabi-storefronts-production\/blogs\/3184\/images\/D8RfcruaRMWQtgzOjdvZ_Screen_Shot_2019-07-08_at_1.55.29_PM.png\" width=\"602\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Now we have even more interesting verifications on the ORL device.

    "summary": "<p>Before we move on to more advanced topics, we'll wrap up this OSPF Basics series in Part 3. Here we'll examine LSA types, area types, and virtual links.<\/p>\n<h2>OSPF LSA Types<\/h2>\n<p>Link State Advertisements (LSA) are the lifeblood of an OSPF network. The flooding of these updates (and the requests for this information) allow the OSPF network to create a map of the network. This occurs with a little help from Dijkstra&rsquo;s Shortest Path First Algorithm.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Not all OSPF LSAs are created equal. Here is a look at each:<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Router (Type 1) LSA&nbsp;<\/strong>- We begin with what many call the &ldquo;fundamental&rdquo; or &ldquo;building block&rdquo; Link State Advertisement. The Type 1 LSA (also known as the Router LSA) is flooded within an area. It describes the interfaces of the local router that are participating in OSPF and the neighbors the local OSPF speaker has established.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Network (Type 2) LSA&nbsp;<\/strong>- Remember how OSPF functions on an Ethernet (broadcast) segment. It elects a Designated Router (DR) and Backup Designated Router (BDR) in order to reduce the number of adjacencies that must be formed and the chaos that would result from a full mesh of these relationships. The Type 2 LSA is sent by the Designated Router into the local area. This LSA describes all of the routers that are attached to that Ethernet segment.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Summary (Type 3) LSA&nbsp;<\/strong>- Recall that your Type 1 and Type 2 LSAs are sent within an area. We call these intra-area LSAs. Now it is time for the first of our inter-area LSAs. The Summary (Type 3) LSA is used for advertising prefixes learned from the Type 1 and Type 2 LSAs into a different area. The Area Border Router (ABR) is the OSPF device that separates areas and it is this device that advertises the Type 3 LSA.<\/p>\n<p>Examine the OSPF topology shown in Figure 1 below.<\/p>\n<p><img height=\"134\" src=\"https:\/\/kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net\/kajabi-storefronts-production\/blogs\/3184\/images\/D2dByMe8RPqfK4KWiMel_Fig_Y-2.PNG\" width=\"599\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Figure 1: A Sample Multi-Area OSPF Topology<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Area 1 ABR would send the Type 3 LSAs into Area 0. The ABR joining Area 0 and Area 2 would send these Type 3 LSAs into Area 2 to provide full reachability in the OSPF domain. The Type 3 LSAs remain Type 3 LSAs during this journey, it is just OSPF costs and advertising router details that change in the advertisements. Notice also that in this example we are describing a multi-area OSPF design that is not using any special area types like Stub or Totally Stubby areas.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The ASBR Summary (Type4) LSA&nbsp;<\/strong>&ndash; There is a special router role in OSPF called the Autonomous System Boundary Router (ASBR). It is the job of this router to bring in external prefix information from another routing domain. In order to inform routers in different areas about the existence of this special router, the Type 4 LSA is used. This Summary LSA provides the router ID of the ASBR. So once again, the Area Border Router is responsible for shooting this information into the next area and we have another example of an inter-area LSA.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The External (Type 5) LSA&nbsp;<\/strong>- So the ASBR is the device that is bringing in prefixes from other routing domains. The Type 4 LSA describes this device. But what LSA is used for the actual prefixes that are coming in from the other domain? Yes, it is the Type 5 LSA. The OSPF ASBR creates these LSAs and they are sent to the Area Border Routers for dissemination into the other areas. Remember, this might change if we are using special area types.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The NSSA External (Type 7) LSA&nbsp;<\/strong>- Remember that in OPSF there is a VERY special area type called a Not So Stubby Area (NSSA). This area can act stub, but it can also bring in external prefixes from an ASBR. These prefixes are sent as Type 7 LSAs. When an ABR gets these Type 7 LSAs, it sends them alone in to the other areas as a Type 5 LSA. So, the Type 7 designation is just for that very special NSSA area functionality.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Other LSA Types&nbsp;<\/strong>- Are there other LSA types? The short answer is YES. But we do not often encounter these. For example, a Type 6 LSA is used for Multicast OSPF and that technology never really caught on, allowing Protocol Independent Multicast to win out. For completion&rsquo;s sake, here is a complete listing of all of the possible LSA types:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>LSA Type&nbsp;1: Router&nbsp;LSA<\/li>\n<li>LSA Type&nbsp;2: Network&nbsp;LSA<\/li>\n<li>LSA Type&nbsp;3: Summary&nbsp;LSA<\/li>\n<li>LSA Type&nbsp;4: Summary ASBR&nbsp;LSA<\/li>\n<li>LSA Type&nbsp;5: Autonomous system external&nbsp;LSA<\/li>\n<li>LSA Type&nbsp;6: Multicast&nbsp;OSPF LSA<\/li>\n<li>LSA Type&nbsp;7: Not-so-stubby area&nbsp;LSA<\/li>\n<li>LSA Type&nbsp;8: External attribute&nbsp;LSA&nbsp;for BGP<\/li>\n<li>LSA Types 9, 10, and 11: &ldquo;Opaque&rdquo; LSA types used for application-specific purposes<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>OSPF&nbsp;LSA Types and Area Types<\/h2>\n<p>One of the reasons that you should master the different LSA types is the fact that it can help you fully understand the potential importance of a multi-area design, especially one that might include special areas. A key to the importance of special area types in OSPF is the fact that they initiate the automatic filtering of certain LSAs from certain areas.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>For example, think about Area 1 attached to the backbone area of Area 0. There are Type 1 LSAs flooding in this Area 1. If we have broadcast segments, we also have Type 2 LSAs circulating in the area. The Area Border Router is sending LSA Type 3s into the backbone to summarize the prefix information from Area 1.<\/p>\n<p>This ABR is also taking in this information from the backbone for other areas that might exist. If there is an ASBR out there in the domain somewhere, our Area 1 will receive Type 4 and Type 5 LSAs in order to know the location of this ASBR and the prefixes it is sharing with us. Note that this is the potential for a lot of information being shared between areas. This is precisely why we have special area types!<\/p>\n<p><strong>OSPF LSAs and the Stub Area<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>What is it that we want to accomplish with a stub area? We do not want to hear about those prefixes that are external to our OSPF domain. Remember what those were? Sure, they are the Type 5 LSAs. In fact, we do not even want to hear about those Type 4 LSAs that are used to call out the ASBR in the network. So the stub area is full of Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3 LSAs. In fact, how would this area get to one of those external prefixes if it needed to? We typically use a very special Type 3 LSA for this. This LSA represents the default route (0.0.0.0\/0). It is this handy route that allows devices in this area to get to all of those externals. In fact, it is this router that is used to get to any prefix not specifically defined in the Routing Information Base (RIB).<\/p>\n<p><strong>OSPF LSAs and the Totally Stubby Area<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>With this area, we want very little inside it from an LSA perspective. &nbsp;With this area, it makes sense that we are blocking those Type 4 and Type 5 once again, but now we are even blocking the Type 3 LSAsthat are describing prefix information from other areas WITHIN our OSPF domain. There needs to be one big exception, however. We need a Type 3 LSA for a default route so we can actually get to other prefixes in our domain.<\/p>\n<p><strong>OSPF LSAs and the Not So Stubby Area and the Totally Not So Stubby Area<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Remember, the Not So Stubby Area needs to have those Type 7 LSAs. These Type 7 LSAs permit the proliferation of those external prefixes that are entering your OSPF domain thanks to this NSSA area you created. Obviously, this area also has the Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3 inside it. Type 4 and Type 5 will be blocked from entering this area as you would expect. You can also create a Totally Not So Stubby Area by restricting Type 3s from this area.<\/p>\n<h2>Virtual Links<\/h2>\n<p>You might recall from our earlier discussion of OSPF that all areas in an OSPF autonomous system must be physically connected to the backbone area (Area 0). Where this is not possible, you can use a virtual link to connect to the backbone through a non-backbone area.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Keep the following facts in mind about your virtual links:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>They should never be considered a design goal in your networks. They are a temporary &ldquo;fix&rdquo; for a violation of the rules of OSPF.<\/li>\n<li>You can also use virtual links to connect two parts of a partitioned backbone through a non-backbone area.<\/li>\n<li>The area through which you configure the virtual link, known as a transit area, must have full routing information.<\/li>\n<li>The transit area cannot be a stub area.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You create the virtual link with a single command in OSPF configuration mode:<br \/><img src=\"https:\/\/kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net\/kajabi-storefronts-production\/blogs\/3184\/images\/mgp1I12SSmHvBPN1tg6J_Screen_Shot_2019-07-08_at_1.24.27_PM.png\" \/><br \/>This command creates a virtual link through area 1 with a remote OSPF device with Router ID 3.3.3.3. You configure that remote OSPF device with a virtual-link command as well. For example, if our local OSPF device is at Router ID 1.1.1.1, the appropriate remote command would be:<br \/><img src=\"https:\/\/kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net\/kajabi-storefronts-production\/blogs\/3184\/images\/CXQxI0LtSMKSTsZ02AUs_Screen_Shot_2019-07-08_at_1.24.18_PM.png\" \/><br \/>NOTE: A virtual link is just one patch for a broken OSPF implementation. You could also use a GRE tunnel to patch the OSPF topology.<\/p>\n<p>That wraps up our look at basic OSPF concepts. In the upcoming series of blog posts, we'll begin examining advanced topics and configuration. Until then, take good care.<\/p>",

If there is an ASBR out there in the domain somewhere, our Area 1 will receive Type 4 and Type 5 LSAs in order to know the location of this ASBR and the prefixes it is sharing with us. Note that this is the potential for a lot of information being shared between areas. This is precisely why we have special area types!<\/p>\n<p><strong>OSPF LSAs and the Stub Area<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>What is it that we want to accomplish with a stub area? We do not want to hear about those prefixes that are external to our OSPF domain. Remember what those were? Sure, they are the Type 5 LSAs. In fact, we do not even want to hear about those Type 4 LSAs that are used to call out the ASBR in the network. So the stub area is full of Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3 LSAs. In fact, how would this area get to one of those external prefixes if it needed to? We typically use a very special Type 3 LSA for this. This LSA represents the default route (0.0.0.0\/0). It is this handy route that allows devices in this area to get to all of those externals. In fact, it is this router that is used to get to any prefix not specifically defined in the Routing Information Base (RIB).<\/p>\n<p><strong>OSPF LSAs and the Totally Stubby Area<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>With this area, we want very little inside it from an LSA perspective. &nbsp;With this area, it makes sense that we are blocking those Type 4 and Type 5 once again, but now we are even blocking the Type 3 LSAsthat are describing prefix information from other areas WITHIN our OSPF domain. There needs to be one big exception, however. We need a Type 3 LSA for a default route so we can actually get to other prefixes in our domain.<\/p>\n<p><strong>OSPF LSAs and the Not So Stubby Area and the Totally Not So Stubby Area<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Remember, the Not So Stubby Area needs to have those Type 7 LSAs. These Type 7 LSAs permit the proliferation of those external prefixes that are entering your OSPF domain thanks to this NSSA area you created. Obviously, this area also has the Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3 inside it. Type 4 and Type 5 will be blocked from entering this area as you would expect. You can also create a Totally Not So Stubby Area by restricting Type 3s from this area.<\/p>\n<h2>Virtual Links<\/h2>\n<p>You might recall from our earlier discussion of OSPF that all areas in an OSPF autonomous system must be physically connected to the backbone area (Area 0). Where this is not possible, you can use a virtual link to connect to the backbone through a non-backbone area.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Keep the following facts in mind about your virtual links:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>They should never be considered a design goal in your networks. They are a temporary &ldquo;fix&rdquo; for a violation of the rules of OSPF.<\/li>\n<li>You can also use virtual links to connect two parts of a partitioned backbone through a non-backbone area.<\/li>\n<li>The area through which you configure the virtual link, known as a transit area, must have full routing information.<\/li>\n<li>The transit area cannot be a stub area.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You create the virtual link with a single command in OSPF configuration mode:<br \/><img src=\"https:\/\/kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net\/kajabi-storefronts-production\/blogs\/3184\/images\/mgp1I12SSmHvBPN1tg6J_Screen_Shot_2019-07-08_at_1.24.27_PM.png\" \/><br \/>This command creates a virtual link through area 1 with a remote OSPF device with Router ID 3.3.3.3. You configure that remote OSPF device with a virtual-link command as well. For example, if our local OSPF device is at Router ID 1.1.1.1, the appropriate remote command would be:<br \/><img src=\"https:\/\/kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net\/kajabi-storefronts-production\/blogs\/3184\/images\/CXQxI0LtSMKSTsZ02AUs_Screen_Shot_2019-07-08_at_1.24.18_PM.png\" \/><br \/>NOTE: A virtual link is just one patch for a broken OSPF implementation. You could also use a GRE tunnel to patch the OSPF topology.<\/p>\n<p>That wraps up our look at basic OSPF concepts. In the upcoming series of blog posts, we'll begin examining advanced topics and configuration. Until then, take good care.<\/p>"

The onboarding experience needs to be as effortless as possible for employees, customers, and guests. As we all know, this can often be a big challenge for any enterprise, which is why at Extreme Networks, we are always looking for ways to make that experience easier for the user. This is why we offer many options such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.extremenetworks.com\/resources\/webinar\/private-pre-shared-key-ppsk-effortless-wi-fi-security\/\">PPSK security<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.extremenetworks.com\/resources\/webinar\/wi-fi-guests-of-honor-guest-access-and-analytics-via-the-cloud\/\">ExtremeGuest Essentials<\/a> to make that first-time connection a pleasant experience. Always remember that the first-time experience, as well as the ongoing experience of your wireless and wired network users, is the top priority.<\/p>\n<p>However, in this blog, I want to focus on an onboarding experience for an often-overlooked person, the <em>installer<\/em>.\u00a0 I speak of the customer or partner employee whose job is to properly mount the access points into the ceiling during a Wi-Fi deployment. This is not easy work. The last thing an installer needs to worry about is if an AP is properly provisioned with all of the appropriate radio and network configuration settings. And the installer should be able to effortlessly provision an AP into the proper cloud management account.<\/p>\n<p>We often hear the phrase, <em>zero-touch provisioning<\/em>, but can we be honest? Somebody always has to touch an AP when it is being installed.\u00a0 So how about instead we offer <em>effortless provisioning<\/em> for the hardworking installer? That is why we have recently released the first version of a smartphone application called <strong>ExtremeCloud IQ Mobile Onboarding<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><img height=\"219\" src=\"https:\/\/kapost-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\/kapost\/55ba7c9e07003d9aab000394\/studio\/content\/601956b49b4c930130399a8d\/html_bodies\/1612274614-5886a1f3-c823-4e2a-916e-7b6a370446d8\/Mobile%20APP%20Image%201.2.PNG\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" width=\"226\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Figure 1 \u2013 ExtremeCloud IQ Mobile Onboarding icon<\/em><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.extremenetworks.com\/extremecloud-iq\/\">ExtremeCloud IQ<\/a> partners and customers can now leverage this mobile application for effortless onboarding.

The <em>ExtremeCloud IQ Mobile Onboarding<\/em> application was designed to securely support the mobile IT administrator when performing network management functions on the go. The application is simple to deploy, has a user-friendly interface, and operates on both <a href=\"https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/xiqmobileonboarding\/id1526789768\">iPhones<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/AndroidExtremeMoible\">Android<\/a> devices.<\/p>\n<p>Now imagine you\u2019re an installer, and you are at a worksite, diligently onboarding access points. You open the mobile app on your phone, and right away, you can see any APs that you have already provisioned into your cloud account, as shown in Figure 2.<\/p>\n<p><img height=\"507\" src=\"https:\/\/kapost-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\/kapost\/55ba7c9e07003d9aab000394\/studio\/content\/601956b49b4c930130399a8d\/html_bodies\/1612274293-4bd14efc-9f5c-4db7-aea1-fe8545e0a159\/Mobile%20APP%20Image%202.7.PNG\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" width=\"800\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Figure 2 \u2013 Onboarding \u00a0APs<\/em><\/p>\n<p>But you need to onboard 35 more APs this afternoon, so you use your smartphones\u2019 camera to scan the barcode or QR code on the AP\u2019s shipping box or on the back of the AP itself. This grabs the serial number of the AP that you are provisioning into your ExtremeCloud IQ account. After that, it really is as simple as 1-2-3 for the installer. As shown in Figure 3, the installer first verifies the AP model and serial number. Second, the installer selects the proper <em>location<\/em> and floorplan for the AP. And third, the installer chooses the pre-configured <em>network policy<\/em> that will be used to configure the AP.<\/p>\n<p><img height=\"495\" src=\"https:\/\/kapost-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\/kapost\/55ba7c9e07003d9aab000394\/studio\/content\/601956b49b4c930130399a8d\/html_bodies\/1612273837-5800bb6a-2934-44ab-8cce-b05bf780b1c0\/Mobile%20APP%20Image%203.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" width=\"748\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Figure 3 &#8211; Onboarding as easy as 1-2-3<\/em><\/p>\n<p>After that, the installer can mount the AP. Once the AP is connected to an Ethernet cable and powered via PoE, the device automatically connects to your ExtremeCloud IQ account. The AP then downloads all the necessary settings to become fully operational in a few short minutes.<\/p>\n<p>As any good Wi-Fi expert will tell you, validation of an initial Wi-Fi deployment is critical. Therefore, the installer has the option to remove the device, change the network policy or location, flash the LED light or reboot the AP. As shown in Figure 4, our installer can also run command-line interface (CLI) diagnostics for the AP using the mobile application that is talking directly to the cloud.<\/p>\n<p><img height=\"614\" src=\"https:\/\/kapost-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\/kapost\/55ba7c9e07003d9aab000394\/studio\/content\/601956b49b4c930130399a8d\/html_bodies\/1612273906-caabc2f2-001f-4d70-b5dd-9666b6424ed9\/Mobile%20APP%20Image%204.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" width=\"671\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Figure 4 &#8211; Validation and Diagnostics<\/em><\/p>\n<p>So, we would like to think we have made life easier for an AP installation professional.

Users can easily conjure an image of ransomware, picturing a big red screen with a skull and cross bones symbol; this type of malware usually resonates more deeply due to the direct impact on users. But IoT threats, while they may not have the same reputation, can cause equal if not more damage.<\/p>\n<p>Malicious cyber players quickly recognized that IoT devices were the perfect avenue for botnet development. IoT removes the need for attackers to trick victims into doing something; if the botnet can infect an IoT device on the network and that device is on the same segment or connected to users on the network, then it can hop from the IoT device to the user\u2019s PC very much like a biological virus can hop from animal to human under the right circumstances. Well-designed botnets do not care about the end points or node specifics, and most have the ability to sit on Linux, a very common IoT operating system (OS), or any other OS such as Windows or even Android and IOS.<\/p>\n<p>There are five broad reasons why IoT is such a high threat:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>IoT devices are often unknown to the IT administration staff. Statistics show that up to 60% of IT administrators surveyed indicated that they had little or no confidence that they were aware of all IoT devices in their networks. You cannot secure what you are not aware of.<\/li>\n<li>Many IoT devices have known vulnerabilities and can be difficult to patch or update. Also, in many instances, IoT devices have firmware levels that often are not addressed in patch or software upgrades.<\/li>\n<li>Many IoT devices have default passwords that, even after being changed, will resurface upon reboot due to the issue noted above.<\/li>\n<li>Often there is no clear understanding of an IoT device\u2019s defined perimeters of behavior. This can be the case even when the device is known to IT staff. As a result, it becomes very difficult to pick out any unusual behaviors that might point to malware infection.<\/li>\n<li>IoT systems are largely heterogenous and might include devices that we might not think of as IoT. For example, everyone would refer to building controls systems or video surveillance as IoT, but few would recognize the IP phone on their desk or the network printer in the corner of the office.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>We could go on, but these serve as the major issues to the overall challenge of protecting the IoT environment. Now let\u2019s take a quick look at methods that can be used to address these challenges.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>1. Asset inventory and vulnerability assessment<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">The first step in getting a handle on the challenge is to do an exhaustive inventory of all devices on the network. Some cases may be straightforward, but other environments can require investigation and even manual walkthroughs to identify IoT devices that may have escaped notice. Having an audited Network Access Control (NAC) will give you a starting point, allowing IT administrators to use MAC addresses to get a rough idea of the device\u2019s location. They can then follow up on the device, verify it, and identify it as an asset. This identification should include not only the device and type but the running software revision as well as ownership and purpose.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Once this information has been obtained, vulnerability assessments should be performed as well as investigation into the device software architecture and intended function. If possible, speak to the actual vendor to understand the device\u2019s intention and the normal patterns of communication that should be expected. This will be important information moving forward.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">It\u2019s also important to provide awareness education to employees about the risk of bringing personal IoT devices into work. If possible, simply prohibit it or require a device registration process so that all devices can be properly audited.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>2. Develop a micro-segmentation strategy for IoT<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">As pointed out earlier, having different types of IoT devices and users on the same network segment is a bad idea from a security perspective. IoT should always be segmented away from the normal user IT environment, and the least privilege logic should dictate the rule of segmentation design. Put simply, if a device does not require connectivity to a system, then it should not have the potential to connect. In many instances, IoT segments can be totally isolated with no connectivity to the user IT environment in any way. A good example of this is digital signage or television, which is only visual and does not need to be given access to the network otherwise. As a result, there is no need for this system to be directly connected to the enterprise IT environment. Many IoT and even Industrial Control System (ICS) fit into this category. They operate quite well in isolation or with very restricted communication.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">In addition to segmentation, IT administrators should communicate with the vendor of the IoT device to understand the normal traffic behavior from the device, as well as a pattern of communication that will result in the required \u2018footprint\u2019 of connectivity. This footprint indicates the systems that the device needs to see and communicate with, allowing IT to create a traffic policy and a segmented design. These things can be the same or different. If they are the same, then the segment design is sufficient, and policy can be reduced to access only. In more complex examples, policies may be required to restrict allowed communications from the device in question. This policy must match the normalized communication patterns but deny all others. If this practice is followed diligently, then IoT systems can be effectively isolated from the normal enterprise IT environment and also from each other to prevent machine-to-machine attacks. If you have done everything correctly up to this point, you should have a series of microsegments, each with dedicated IoT systems and normalized known traffic behaviors and policies to match them.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>3. Vigilance and analysis<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Once a well-segmented, policy-based design is established, the next step is to maintain consistent vigilance of device behaviors within each segment. Remember that while you designed the segment, you took all required traffic patterns into account. As a result, you should have very \u2018sanitary\u2019 microsegments with normalized traffic patterns that can be monitored for anomalies or unusual behaviors. When you see unusual behaviors or anomalies, investigate them as soon as possible. Put simply, if you see an IoT device doing something that it has never done before, it is most likely not a good thing. Ideally, the device should be quarantined quickly until further investigation can take place. If an IoT device is mission-critical and always needs to be online, it requires micro-segmentation and established policies of normal behavior.<\/p>\n<p><strong>In Conclusion<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>While botnets are not new, they have become increasingly sophisticated at an alarming rate and there is no sign that this trend of software evolution will end. While IoT systems have become a new favorite target for ingress and propagation due to the relative weakness of these systems from a security perspective, there are methods to address these challenges. If performed with due diligence, these methods can contribute to the overall security posture of the enterprise in question.<\/p>\n<p><span>The best advice I can give is to never assume that you are totally secure. While we can prove that a system is not secure by compromising it, we cannot totally prove that a system is not secure by failing in the same.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https:\/\/www.extremenetworks.com\/extreme-networks-blog\/why-iot-is-the-latest-attack-vector-for-botnets-and-how-you-can-protect-yourself\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Why IoT is the Latest Attack Vector for Botnets and How You Can Protect Yourself!<\/a> appeared first on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.extremenetworks.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Extreme Networks<\/a>.<\/p>"

We are excited about this opportunity and are finding creative ways to serve others virtually or in a safe, socially distanced manner.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to this year\u2019s theme and the reflections that have been occurring around the world over the past 12 months, we asked some of our employees to share their thoughts and I\u2019m pleased to share them with you.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/kapost-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\/kapost\/55ba7c9e07003d9aab000394\/studio\/content\/6012cf09b429690163142834\/html_bodies\/1612219448-3a7a737f-8ea3-4746-a862-856de2e018e6\/BHM%20Quote%201.jpg\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/kapost-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\/kapost\/55ba7c9e07003d9aab000394\/studio\/content\/6012cf09b429690163142834\/html_bodies\/1612219464-625d9a08-e971-4a9f-b28a-7945dd5948bf\/BHM%20Quote%207.jpg\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/kapost-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\/kapost\/55ba7c9e07003d9aab000394\/studio\/content\/6012cf09b429690163142834\/html_bodies\/1612219486-3db1867d-6f35-4cd0-99e4-b4b87f52d51b\/BHM%20Quote%202.jpg\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/kapost-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\/kapost\/55ba7c9e07003d9aab000394\/studio\/content\/6012cf09b429690163142834\/html_bodies\/1612219497-932c0f7b-0aa0-4e2f-85bc-53ce546c87f9\/BHM%20Quote%205.jpg\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/kapost-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\/kapost\/55ba7c9e07003d9aab000394\/studio\/content\/6012cf09b429690163142834\/html_bodies\/1612219519-1a378994-6cfa-4647-8ff6-ed9ed0e2cc6f\/BHM%20Quote%206.jpg\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/kapost-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\/kapost\/55ba7c9e07003d9aab000394\/studio\/content\/6012cf09b429690163142834\/html_bodies\/1612219530-d1ae46e3-8a28-4291-b11b-58e426ff51a1\/BHM%20Quote%208.jpg\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/kapost-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\/kapost\/55ba7c9e07003d9aab000394\/studio\/content\/6012cf09b429690163142834\/html_bodies\/1612219541-7aa46fb7-9df8-4136-a3d2-4b1462370d9a\/BHM%20Quote%203.jpg\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/kapost-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\/kapost\/55ba7c9e07003d9aab000394\/studio\/content\/6012cf09b429690163142834\/html_bodies\/1612219560-ff9576e5-b2eb-4b88-ad6e-cbbd4af7baeb\/BHM%20Quote%204.jpg\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As many of my colleagues have expressed, the successful path forward for representation, identity, and diversity is going to take an effort from us all to step up, eliminate unconscious biases, and be the best version of ourselves.

        "value": "<p>Every person has obstacles to overcome, but the color of their skin should not be one of them. 156 years after slavery was abolished in the U.S. many people still experience discrimination every day. As I reflect on this year\u2019s Black History Month theme, \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/asalh.org\/black-history-themes\/\">The Black Family: Representation, Identity, and Diversity<\/a>,\u201d I\u2019m reminded of the obstacles African Americans have had to overcome and the opportunity we have to work toward a brighter, more inclusive future.<\/p>\n<p>As African Americans, it is important that we don\u2019t allow our negative experiences to define who we are. Sure, we may have had bouts with racism and bigotry in both our personal and professional lives, but those experiences have fueled me, not set me back. I was raised in a family with a very rich heritage of \u201covercomers,\u201d and it framed a mindset of \u2018positivity\u2019 and hopefulness that shines through in everything that I do. At the end of the day, it comes down to our mindset, and we have the ability to reject negative stereotypes that are imposed by others.<\/p>\n<p>As I look forward, I see a path that is bright. In his book, \u201c7 Habits of Highly Effective People,\u201d <a href=\"https:\/\/www.famousauthors.org\/stephen-r-covey\">Stephen Covey<\/a> says, \u201cSeek first to understand, then to be understood.\u201d In other words, when we seek to really understand, it affirms the other person\u2019s vantage point, and gives them a voice. This is why at Extreme Networks our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.extremenetworks.com\/company\/csr\/\">employee resource groups (ERGs)<\/a> are critical. Our ERGs are designed to bring the \u201cemployee voice\u201d forward. As we share our backgrounds, cultures, and norms, we can more fully understand and embrace our differences.<\/p>\n<p><span>\n\t\t<blockquote class=\"c-event-content-section__quote u-clearfix\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"c-event-content-section__quote-image\">\n\t\t\t\t<div><\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other time. We are the ones we\u2019ve been waiting for. We are the change that we seek.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"c-event-content-section__quote-author\">\n\t\t\t\t\tBarack Obama\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"c-event-content-section__quote-position\">\n\t\t\t\t\t44th President of the United States\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\n\t\t<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Extreme takes its commitment to fostering a more inclusive workplace very seriously. We are embracing diversity and taking steps to make sure our employees\u2019 voices are heard. As the newly appointed Vice President of Talent and HR, I shared with the team earlier this week that I am giving my \u201csoul\u201d to this work. One of our team members called our work, \u201ca calling,\u201d and I agree. This is not about numbers; it\u2019s about creating a workplace that \u201cgives voice\u201d to all of our employees &#8211; our most valuable resource. We want them to speak up and be heard!<\/p>\n<p>To share some of the success we\u2019ve had, our team rolled out a plan for diversity and inclusion in June of 2020. As of today, we have 7 active ERGs and more in development. Within the first 110 days of this program, 16% of Extreme employees plugged into some resource relating to our diversity and inclusion program. Our program has been so successful because our employees are committed and passionate about our core values, and our leadership team has been extremely supportive and passionate as well.<\/p>\n<p>Now that we have our foundation, we are deploying global inclusion training, rolling out sponsorship and allyship programs for under-represented employees, and tying all of our great diversity and inclusion work back to our culture \u2013 which will help us drive better business outcomes. We still have lots of work to do, but we have made significant progress in just a short time because our leaders and employees recognize the value of inclusion and they are committed to our success!<\/p>\n<p><span>\n\t\t<blockquote class=\"c-event-content-section__quote u-clearfix\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"c-event-content-section__quote-image\">\n\t\t\t\t<div><\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which he has overcome while trying to succeed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"c-event-content-section__quote-author\">\n\t\t\t\t\tBooker T.

A few of our partners are seeing the same success as Extreme based on our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=pvGSfHTeNtU&amp;feature=youtu.be\">Blueprint for Inclusion<\/a>. I\u2019ll do a follow-up blog in a few weeks detailing our five steps to increase diversity and inclusion in your organization, but to give you a sneak peek, they include:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Hire or appoint a Diversity and Inclusion Leader<\/li>\n<li>Commit to Diversity and Inclusion goals<\/li>\n<li>Conduct Diversity and Inclusion Training<\/li>\n<li>Establish Employee Resource Groups (ERG)<\/li>\n<li>Establish a cross-functional Diversity and Inclusion Council<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span>\n\t\t<blockquote class=\"c-event-content-section__quote u-clearfix\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"c-event-content-section__quote-image\">\n\t\t\t\t<div><\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The most common way people give up their power is by thinking they don\u2019t have any.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"c-event-content-section__quote-author\">\n\t\t\t\t\tAlice Walker\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"c-event-content-section__quote-position\">\n\t\t\t\t\tNovelist, Author of \"The Color Purple\"\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\n\t\t<\/span><\/p>\n<p>We took the first step at Extreme by fully embracing inclusion into our culture and making it a pillar of our core values. This core value emphasizes that we encourage all of our employees to speak up. We\u2019re fostering an environment that attracts the best talent, values diversity of life experiences and perspectives, and encourages innovation in the pursuit of our corporate mission \u2013 to advance how society connects to each other.<\/p>\n<p>As you reflect on this year\u2019s Black History Month Theme, \u201cThe Black Family: Representation, Identity, and Diversity,\u201d I encourage you to remember the past, celebrate the present, and work to transform the future.

As a result, some additional rules are required to make sure all stayed peaceful on the prairie. While the FCC opened up the 6 GHz band for unlicensed operation for Wi-Fi, they also included some significant restrictions. To begin with, the FCC defines two types of device classifications with very different transmit power rules. Once again, the goal is to avoid potential interference with existing 6 GHz incumbents. The choices now are <em>low power APs<\/em> for indoor Wi-Fi and <em>standard power APs<\/em> for outdoor Wi-Fi. The low power APs, as the name implies, have reduced power levels since they are only used indoors. Any building walls will further attenuate the signals, making any potential interference with existing 6 GHz users very unlikely.<\/span>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><span>Now the outdoor, or standard power APs, are a different story as these have a serious potential of interfering with existing 6 GHz users in the area. Fixed satellite services (FSS) used in the broadcast and cable industries might already have a license for the channels in use. Therefore, any new unlicensed users (Wi-Fi) must ensure they do not impact the current services. As identified by the FCC, the answer to this is to create a way to coordinate the spectrum use to avoid interference issues.

while designing an in-stadium Wi-Fi solution for a full capacity stadium is a challenge, configuring that Wi-Fi solution to meet the fan-facing and business-facing connectivity needs in a limited capacity stadium is even more challenging.\u00a0 Implementing high-density Wi-Fi solutions requires careful RF channel planning, designed to meet the usage demands of a full-capacity venue (especially for an event like the Super Bowl); a limited capacity venue introduces unpredictability and another level of complexity.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Extreme\u2019s Sports &amp; Public Venues team has designed and deployed Wi-Fi for 12 NFL stadiums, all of which have unique physical characteristics and business needs.\u00a0 Utilizing this experience and expertise \u2013 and working closely with League and team-level counterparts \u2013 Extreme\u2019s Wi-Fi Architects and Solution Engineers have methodically fine-tuned the supporting Wi-Fi solution at this year\u2019s host venue: Raymond James Stadium in Tampa Bay, FL.\u00a0 Over 1,500 wireless APs are installed at the Super Bowl Stadium to deliver fast, secure connectivity to ensure everyone wins on game day.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Defense: Digitizing Event Operations for Safety and Convenience<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">An effective defensive game plan proactively mitigates risk and potential game-changing disruptions; the defensive Wi-Fi network game plan for Super Bowl LV does just that by helping to provide a safe, convenient, quality experience for fans and the supporting event staff.\u00a0 Recent events undoubtedly\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.extremenetworks.com\/extreme-networks-blog\/challenges-and-digital-competencies-essential-for-the-future-of-live-sports\/\">created new and heightened challenges for live sports<\/a>, but it also acted as a catalyst for digital transformation &#8211; which will ultimately further augment the in-stadium experience for fans moving forward.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">On that note,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbssports.com\/nfl\/news\/five-early-2021-super-bowl-predictions-tyreek-hill-wins-super-bowl-mvp-after-big-performance-and-more\/\">Super Bowl LV will be the first Super Bowl where\u00a0<em>all\u00a0<\/em>tickets will be mobile<\/a>.\u00a0 Given the potential benefits for the League, the individual clubs, and its fans, the NFL had already launched a top-down initiative to exclusively migrate to mobile tickets.\u00a0 Super Bowl LV is an excellent opportunity to build upon this endeavor.\u00a0 Not only is mobile ticketing more convenient and seamless, it minimizes physical touchpoints for improved health and safety in-stadium. \u00a0According to Peter O\u2019Reilly, Executive VP of Club Business and League Events, \u201c[mobile ticketing] is clearly safer\u2026we got a touchless experience and the ability to communicate with fans is that much stronger as you lead up to the game, and make sure they understand all the protocols [via] push notifications and others.\u201d From an IT network perspective, providing Wi-Fi connectivity to fans as they enter and traverse the stadium is critical to easily and securely access digital tickets.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Special Teams: Network-Driven Mobile Engagement Analytics\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">The special teams game plan can be a serious x-factor. When strategically utilized to gain a competitive edge, the special teams unit has the ability to drastically influence the outcome on game day.\u00a0 For the Wi-Fi network game plan, special teams represents access to network-driven insights and analytics surrounding in-stadium Wi-Fi and network usage.\u00a0 This actionable intelligence helps the NFL and its clubs better understand the mobile usage patterns and preferences of their fanbase \u2013 not only at key events like the Super Bowl but also across various NFL markets and teams.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Access to real-time and historical data like this can be used to monitor the growth\/evolution of Wi-Fi usage, deliver more personalized experiences to fans, and make more informed decisions in support of an overarching digital strategy \u2013 including investment in mobile, applications, and more.\u00a0 This is the 8<sup>th<\/sup>\u00a0year Extreme Networks is the Official Wi-Fi Analytics Provider of the Super Bowl; 25 NFL teams have ExtremeAnalytics deployed at their stadium.\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.extremenetworks.com\/extreme-networks-blog\/3-wi-fi-takeaways-from-super-bowl-liv\/\">Last year\u2019s Super Bowl saw record-breaking Wi-Fi usage<\/a>, in both the amount of data transferred via Wi-Fi (26.42 TBs) and the average network usage per connected device (595.6 MBs).\u00a0 Since the NFL is planning for a limited capacity stadium this Super Bowl, it\u2019s unlikely the total data transferred will surpass last year\u2019s number, but it will surely be interesting to dig into the analytics regardless.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Related Resources<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For more information on how Extreme Networks works with the NFL, digitized operations for live sports, and more, check out the related resources below:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.extremenetworks.com\/nfl\/\">NFL-Extreme Networks Partnership Page<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.extremenetworks.com\/extreme-networks-blog\/3-wi-fi-takeaways-from-super-bowl-liv\/\">3 Wi-Fi Takeaways from Super Bowl LIV<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/content.extremenetworks.com\/l\/sports-venue-new-nor\">\u2018Reentry Resource Center\u2019 for Sports &amp; Public Venues<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.extremenetworks.com\/extreme-networks-blog\/the-tampa-bay-buccaneers-elevate-the-game-day-experience-with-fan-facing-wi-fi\/\">Tampa Bay Buccaneers Elevate the Game Day Experience with Fan-Facing Wi-Fi\u00a0<\/a>\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https:\/\/www.extremenetworks.com\/extreme-networks-blog\/designing-a-successful-wi-fi-solutions-game-plan-for-super-bowl-lv\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Designing a Successful Wi-Fi Solutions Game Plan for Super Bowl LV<\/a> appeared first on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.extremenetworks.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Extreme Networks<\/a>.<\/p>"

Due to relatively low execution costs, high rates of return, and minimal risk of discovery compared with other forms of malware, ransomware has quickly become a preferred method of attack for cybercriminals.<\/p>\n<p>Although computer systems remain the most common source of ransomware infection, Internet of Things (IoT) devices are also prime targets for several reasons, including the fact that hackers know enterprises often have less visibility into these devices, and can therefore inflict devastating effects without detection. In addition, IoT devices are often not built with security in mind, leaving them vulnerable for exploits. IoT-based attacks can also spread across the network very quickly to maximize damage, and ransomware can render the physical functions of that device inaccessible until the ransom is paid.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there&#8217;s a lot of finger-pointing when it comes to\u00a0who\u00a0is responsible for bolstering IoT security. Often, it&#8217;s up to individual organizations to protect themselves from IoT-based attacks.<\/p>\n<p>Of all the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.datto.com\/blog\/common-types-of-ransomware#:~:text=Common%20Types%20of%20Ransomware.%201%20Bad%20Rabbit%3A%20A,early%202014%2C%20and%20variants%20have%20...%20More%20items\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">types of ransomware<\/a>, one of the most damaging and infamous is WannaCry.\u00a0It is estimated to have affected\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-cyber-attack-europol\/cyber-attack-hits-200000-in-at-least-150-countries-europol-idUSKCN18A0FX\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">more than 200,000 computers<\/a>\u00a0across 150 countries, with total damages ranging from hundreds of millions to billions of dollars.\u00a0WannaCry, as well as other forms of malware and ransomware, leverage a well-known exploit named EternalBlue. It exploits a vulnerability in the Window&#8217;s Server Message Block version 1 (SMB v1) protocol, which allows the malware to spread to all unpatched Windows systems from XP to 2016 on any network that has this protocol enabled.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Although WannaCry was first detected in May 2017, according to Safety Detectives, it still represents\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.safetydetectives.com\/blog\/ransomware-statistics\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.safetydetectives.com\/blog\/ransomware-statistics\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">nearly half of all reported ransomware incidents<\/a>\u00a0in the US today. All EternalBlue-based malware (including WannaCry) exploits the same Windows vulnerability. Since these attacks are still increasing three years later, it&#8217;s evident that there are plenty of unpatched Windows systems still out there.<\/p>\n<p>And again, while WannaCry primarily targets computers, IoT devices were not \u2014 and are not \u2014 immune.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How One Hospital Stopped a WannaCry Attack<\/strong><br \/>In 2019, a European hospital system discovered their ultrasound devices were infected with WannaCry. Several digital imaging and communications in medicine (DICOM) devices were also affected because they were running old versions of MS Windows operating systems. These devices couldn&#8217;t be patched without breaking the device manufacturer&#8217;s warranty and, due to the expense of these devices, couldn&#8217;t easily be replaced.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately, the hospital acted fast and was able to stop this attack. Specifically, they:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Confirmed the existence of the infection on the imaging machines.<\/strong><br \/>The hospital selected one of the suspicious DICOM devices, an ultrasound in the maternity section of the hospital. This was a particularly dangerous case because some of the images and reports could be stolen and held for ransom, or worse, the device could be taken control of and rendered unusable. They performed a traffic capture on the ultrasound device and found a significant number of flows from the ultrasound to the network, using SMB Over TCP (port 445). Since this was the preferred port and known exploit for EternalBlue\/WannaCry, it confirmed that the machine was infected.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Applied security profiles and isolated the affected devices.<\/strong><br \/>Since the ultrasound device couldn&#8217;t be patched or upgraded, they couldn&#8217;t eliminate the infection. However, the hospital was able to contain it and continue using infected medical devices without worrying about infecting the broader network or losing the ultrasound images and files. In order to do this, the hospital used a security solution that could segment and isolate certain devices on the network, so that the infection could be contained within the ultrasound device, preventing propagation through the network. The IT team then applied policies to the ultrasound device to ensure that no UDP\/TCP ports were opened, except those explicitly allowed by the imaging staff and IT managers.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Monitored unattended devices and remained vigilant.\u00a0<\/strong><br \/>The action didn&#8217;t stop when the hospital isolated the known impacted devices. Hospitals and other organizations that have had their computer systems impacted by multiple rounds of WannaCry outbreaks need to confirm that any medical devices (especially those running old versions of MS Windows Operating Systems) haven&#8217;t also been infected. The European hospital verified other devices weren&#8217;t affected, and continued to closely monitor for any suspicious activity.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>The Road Ahead<\/strong><br \/>Cybersecurity experts all agree that ransomware attacks are only going to accelerate and could represent an increased threat to IoT devices in 2020 and beyond. In addition to protecting your computer systems and company data from the threat of a ransomware attack, it is critical to review and update your current IoT security practices, especially for mission critical endpoints such as medical devices and industrial control systems.<\/p>\n<p>Ransomware isn&#8217;t going anywhere, but we can make sure we&#8217;re prepared for the next time it strikes.<\/p>\n<p><em>This article was originally published to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.darkreading.com\/risk\/wannacry-has-iot-in-its-crosshairs\/a\/d-id\/1338894\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dark Reading<\/a> on September 25, 2020.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https:\/\/www.extremenetworks.com\/extreme-networks-blog\/wannacry-has-iot-in-its-crosshairs\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">WannaCry Has IoT in Its Crosshairs<\/a> appeared first on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.extremenetworks.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Extreme Networks<\/a>.<\/p>"

For instance, geo-fencing allows users to know when digitally tagged inventory has left the virtual boundaries of a specific area, allowing managers to keep specific items from being lost or stolen. This solution has been notably helpful in the healthcare industry, where keeping track of expensive equipment is vital for both patients and employees.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Customer engagement can also be analyzed through Wi-Fi and BLE connections, allowing business leaders to pinpoint where customers spend time through proximity location identifiers. The technology can also enable crowd control, by driving notifications if capacity reaches a specified limit on the network.

A Gravity Supply Chain Solutions\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20190213005301\/en\">study<\/a>\u00a0found that even before COVID-19 struck, 85% of U.S. retailers were still in the process of digitizing their end-to-end supply chain.<\/p>\n<p>COVID-19 is forcing a new wave of digitization in every aspect of business. For supply chain managers, it\u2019s time to consider how introducing and expanding IoT technology \u2013 supported by the network \u2013 can accelerate transformation efforts to increase operational efficiency.<\/p>\n<h4><span class=\"icon\"><\/span>Increase warehouse operational efficiency with Wi-Fi<\/h4>\n<p>The idea of warehouse automation often connotes future-forward technology, such as exoskeleton suites, drones, and robots. Leading retailers and brands have made these visions a reality by deploying robotic carts and robust warehouse management systems in their distribution and fulfillment centers to expedite the movement of goods. However, other, less hyped technologies \u2014 such as\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/internetofthingsagenda.techtarget.com\/definition\/RFID-radio-frequency-identification\">RFID<\/a>\u00a0scanners, tablets, and IoT sensors \u2014 also play a critical role in warehouse automation to help operators pick, pack, and ship goods as quickly as possible.<\/p>\n<p>These\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/internetofthingsagenda.techtarget.com\/feature\/IIoT-and-remote-work-keep-distributed-operations-moving\">advancements in warehouse automation<\/a>\u00a0would not be possible without high-capacity Wi-Fi to ensure reliable, seamless connectivity throughout the warehouse.\u00a0Maintaining that connectivity is no small feat. Cavernous spaces, countless Wi-Fi signal obstacles \u2014 such as machinery, racks, and conveyors \u2014 and the multitude of connected devices mean that intentional access point placement and access to real-time network performance are critical to keeping operations running smoothly. With the holiday peak season on the horizon, supply chain managers can\u2019t afford operations disruptions or delays due to poor connections and devices not functioning properly. That\u2019s why it\u2019s paramount for leaders to take the time now to evaluate their fulfillment center Wi-Fi performance and adjust as needed.<\/p>\n<h4><span class=\"icon\"><\/span>Cut transportation costs with autonomous tracking and location analytics<\/h4>\n<p>Road freight is the largest expenditure in the $1.6 trillion U.S. logistics industry, according to a Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/cscmp.org\/CSCMP\/Educate\/State_of_Logistics_2020.aspx\">report<\/a>. There\u2019s also a continued scarcity of available trucks and drivers across the country especially as the ongoing health crisis persists. Supply chain teams are feeling the pressure to map out the most strategic fulfillment network transportation arcs to achieve on-time, in-full deliveries.<\/p>\n<p>Leading providers have adopted IoT-enabled weight sensors to support inventory management during load in, load out and transit, as well as ensure freight safety and compliance. They help reduce accidents, break downs and vehicle damage caused by excess inventory or incorrect weight distribution. Additionally, many truck fleets are equipped with\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/internetofthingsagenda.techtarget.com\/blog\/IoT-Agenda\/Build-a-data-streaming-AI-and-machine-learning-platform-for-IoT\">sensors to track real-time data<\/a>\u00a0such as vehicle fuel efficiency and road conditions. Drivers are then notified of possible alternative routes to reduce fuel consumption and travel time. Both uses of weight and roadway sensors rely on advanced analytics solutions and asset tracking systems. These systems are supported by\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/searcherp.techtarget.com\/news\/252490926\/Partnerships-add-more-supply-chain-visibility-to-SAP-LBN\">centralized, cloud-based networking<\/a>\u00a0and technologies that can provide real-time data, accessible to the entire organization. In turn, supply chain managers can ensure that scarce transportation resources remain fully operational and that their drivers are safe.<\/p>\n<h4><span class=\"icon\"><\/span>Improve inventory visibility and replenishment with in-store connected devices<\/h4>\n<p>Beyond warehousing and transportation, the pandemic also brought a renewed focus to inventory replenishment and management strategies across brick-and-mortar stores. In recent years, retailers and brands began connecting back-end warehouse and order management systems with front-end inventory management to keep shelves stocked and to support new omnichannel fulfillment options such as\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/searchcustomerexperience.techtarget.com\/definition\/BOPUS-buy-online-pick-up-in-store\">buy-online-pick-up-in-store<\/a>\u00a0(BOPIS) and ship from store. These emerging fulfillment strategies have been put to the test in the wake of the ongoing health crisis. A Qudini retail SaaS provider\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.qudini.com\/62-of-us-consumers-more-likely-to-use-buy-online-pick-up-in-store-bopis-services-to-reduce-exposure-to-covid-19-survey-finds\/\">survey<\/a>\u00a0found that 62% of U.S. consumers are more likely to use BOPIS services to reduce exposure to COVID-19.<\/p>\n<p>Both BOPIS and ship from store rely on IoT devices such as scanners, tablets and mobile phones to keep track of inventory on the floor and in the backrooms of physical stores. Even in stores where consumer foot traffic has slowed, Wi-Fi access remains a top priority to support inventory visibility. Store employees rely on the network to manage stock levels accurately and fulfill orders quickly. Few things are more frustrating for consumers than venturing to the store in the middle of a health crisis only to find that their pre-ordered items are out of stock. Store operations managers depend on the in-store IoT devices that support inventory management and replenishment to maintain the flow of goods to consumers who need them.<\/p>\n<h4><span class=\"icon\"><\/span>Preparing supply chains for the next inevitable disruption<\/h4>\n<p>Digitizing the supply chain is no longer optional. As the pandemic continues to evolve, organizations across every industry are readying their supply chains in anticipation of what\u2019s to come. The potential benefits of IoT technology \u2014 including reducing transportation costs, increasing operational efficiency in the warehouse and streamlining inventory management \u2014 are endless.<\/p>\n<p><em>This article was originally published to\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/internetofthingsagenda.techtarget.com\/blog\/IoT-Agenda\/3-ways-a-reliable-network-helps-digitize-supply-chains\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IoT Agenda<\/a>\u00a0on September 21, 2020.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https:\/\/www.extremenetworks.com\/extreme-networks-blog\/3-ways-reliable-network-helps-digitize-supply-chains\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">3 Ways Reliable Network Helps Digitize Supply Chains<\/a> appeared first on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.extremenetworks.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Extreme Networks<\/a>.<\/p>"

It is a one-way function, and since there is no relation between both the text being interpreted and the summary value, it is difficult to derive the actual data from the summary value received. The same meaning for the same data is produced in the hash process, but the value provided by the hash function often varies when there is a minor shift. Digest functions are typically used in fields such as data integrity authentication, password storage, digital signature, message verification code, etc. Blockchain implementations, which are common today, are another field of use.<\/p>\n<p>Cryptographic <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2016\/dec\/15\/passwords-hacking-hashing-salting-sha-2\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" style=\"color: #0000ff;\" target=\"_blank\">hash functions<\/a><\/span> create a particular length of output (e.g. 20 bytes) independent of the size of the input they obtain. The manufactured output is unique to the input given. For the same source, the same output still arises, and the output of 2 distinct inputs cannot be the same as each other. &#8220;message digest&#8221;, &#8220;hash&#8221;, &#8220;checksum&#8221; and &#8220;digital fingerprint&#8221; can be considered the output of the cryptographic hash function. In high-level protection software, they are favored for that purpose.<\/p>\n<p>Usage areas are wide, but they are mainly used for data validation purposes in Cryptography since the working principle of hash functions greatly align with mining technology. Let\u2019s now look at general usage areas of hash functions:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Instead of retaining user passwords in web apps, the most commonplace of use might be to download and save Hashes in the database. The hash of the user&#8217;s password during site authentication is collected and stored in the username database. The hash of the user&#8217;s password is taken and contrasted with the stored hash after signing into the site. The same hash means that during authentication, the password provided by the user and the password provided throughout login are the same, and login is permitted.<\/li>\n<li>As a second and still effective area of use, cryptographic hash functions allow us to understand when the validity of the data we change in data exchanges on the internet is compromised.<\/li>\n<li>Another use case is to compare big files in situations where the CPU is expensive to compare their content. E.g., by using their Hash, we can easily detect multiplexed picture and video files on our device. We might claim that files with the same Hash are reproduced if we take the Hash of all files once and also save them with the file path.<\/li>\n<li>Today, popular Blockchain apps are another area of use (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.). Hash&#8217;s are commonly used in<span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"> <a href=\"https:\/\/networkinterview.com\/blockchain-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-technology\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" style=\"color: #0000ff;\" target=\"_blank\">blockchain<\/a><\/span> implementations since &#8220;Proof-of-work&#8221; can be presented with the most apparent feature to consider.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Why Does Hashing Functions Matter?<\/h2>\n<p>It has a wide variety of applications, including conventional hash functions, searches of records, broad analysis of files, and management of data. From the other direction, in information technology systems, such as message authentication and electronic fingerprinting, cryptographic hash functions are commonly utilized. <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/news\/cryptographic-hash-functions\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" style=\"color: #0000ff;\" target=\"_blank\">Cryptographic hash functions<\/a><\/span> are a crucial component of the mining process leading up to Bitcoin and play a role in creating new addresses and keys as well.<\/p>\n<h2>Mining<\/h2>\n<p>For Bitcoin mining, several measures involve hash functions, including checking balance, connecting inputs and outputs of payments, and hashing transfers within a block to form the Merkle Tree. But one of the key reasons the Bitcoin network is safe is that before they can find a feasible solution to the next block, miners need to do a lot of hashing.<\/p>\n<h2>Encryption vs Hashing<\/h2>\n<p>Encryption is a two-way function where, using an encryption key, information is encrypted and then decoded using a decryption key. The information is encrypted in a way that it can be read-only by approved parties. It is used to discourage unauthorized users from accessing a file&#8217;s data by making it unreadable. Most of our ordinary user security and authentication tools are based on encryption protocols such as Two Factor Authentication, SSL security protocols Virtual Private Networks whether enterprise-level or <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wizcase.com\/blog\/maybe-a-free-VPN-is-the-right-choice-for-you\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" style=\"color: #0000ff;\" target=\"_blank\">options including going for safe free VPNs<\/a><\/span>. Because encryption aims to safely transfer data (i.e., maintain the security of data).<\/p>\n<p>While on the other hand, the purpose of hashing is to validate data (i.e., protect data integrity). Hashing is a one-way feature where an input data or a string of text produces a unique message digest. It is the method of mapping it to a fixed size output using hash functions on data. It is identical to a checksum which is used to validate the consistency of the file and is useful for comparing an entered value to a stored value without having to interpret the original value.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\">Continue Reading:<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><em><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/ipwithease.com\/cisco-ssh-version-1-and-2-detailed-comparison\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" style=\"color: #0000ff;\" target=\"_blank\">Cisco SSH Version 1 and 2<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p><em><strong><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/ipwithease.com\/how-does-a-browser-verify-an-ssl-certificate\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" style=\"color: #0000ff;\" target=\"_blank\">How does a Browser verify an SSL Certificate?<\/a><\/span><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Fhash-functions%2F&amp;linkname=Hash%20Functions%20and%20What%20they%20Offer%20for%20Security%20in%20Cryptography\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Facebook\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Fhash-functions%2F&amp;linkname=Hash%20Functions%20and%20What%20they%20Offer%20for%20Security%20in%20Cryptography\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Twitter\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_linkedin\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Fhash-functions%2F&amp;linkname=Hash%20Functions%20and%20What%20they%20Offer%20for%20Security%20in%20Cryptography\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"LinkedIn\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_whatsapp\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/whatsapp?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Fhash-functions%2F&amp;linkname=Hash%20Functions%20and%20What%20they%20Offer%20for%20Security%20in%20Cryptography\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"WhatsApp\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_email\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Fhash-functions%2F&amp;linkname=Hash%20Functions%20and%20What%20they%20Offer%20for%20Security%20in%20Cryptography\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Email\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_reddit\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Fhash-functions%2F&amp;linkname=Hash%20Functions%20and%20What%20they%20Offer%20for%20Security%20in%20Cryptography\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Reddit\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_pinterest\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/pinterest?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Fhash-functions%2F&amp;linkname=Hash%20Functions%20and%20What%20they%20Offer%20for%20Security%20in%20Cryptography\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pinterest\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_counter addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Fhash-functions%2F&#038;title=Hash%20Functions%20and%20What%20they%20Offer%20for%20Security%20in%20Cryptography\"><\/a><\/p>"

Here is everything you need to know about the Open Source Operating Systems.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>What is Open Source Operating System?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>To understand it, first, you should know <strong>what is Open source?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Open source refers to the computer software or applications where the owners or copyright holders allow the users or third party to see, use and provide the right to modify the source code of the product.<\/p>\n<p>An <strong>Open-source Operating System<\/strong> is the Operating System in which source code is visible publically and editable.\u00a0 The generally known Operating Systems like <strong>Microsoft&#8217;s Windows, <a href=\"https:\/\/ipwithease.com\/android-vs-ios-comparing-the-best-features\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">Apple&#8217;s iOS<\/span><\/a> and Mac OS, and <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/ipwithease.com\/linux-vs-android\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" style=\"color: #0000ff;\" target=\"_blank\">Android<\/a><\/span> are closed Operating system.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Closed Operating Systems are built with numerous codes and complex programming and that is called source code. This source code is kept secret by the respective companies (owners) and inaccessible to third parties. By doing so, they ensure the safety and secure the Operating System and computer from any threats.<\/p>\n<p>In the case of an Open Source Operating system, everyone can access and edit the source code.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>How Open Source Operating System Works?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Open Source Operating System works the same as the closed ones; the only difference is that the source code or the whole application is modifiable by the user. There is no difference in performance, but there can be a difference in functioning.<\/p>\n<p>For example, in a proprietary (closed) Operating system, the information is packed and stored. The same happens in the Open Source. But since the source code is visible to you (user) you can understand the process and alter the way information is processed.<\/p>\n<p>While the former is secure and hassle-free, the latter needs some technical knowledge, but you can customize and increase performance.\u00a0 The difference and Pros &amp; Cons are discussed later in the article.<\/p>\n<p>There is no defined way or framework for the Open Source Operating System working; it can be customized based on the user needs.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Types of Open Source Operating System<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Most of the Open Source Operating Systems are Linux based.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.kernel.org\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" style=\"color: #0000ff;\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Linux Kernel<\/strong> <\/a><\/span>is created by <strong>Linus Torvalds.<\/strong> It provides the core functions needed for an Operating System like Parcelling of data, processing of memory, and interactions with the computer hardware. Linux is open-source many developers studied the source code and created many supportive plug-ins and operating systems for their needs. Though Linux is the heart of the operating systems, there are also some Open Source<\/li>\n<li>Operating Systems that are <strong>not based on Linux.<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There are many types of Operating systems that differ between them based on their goal and purpose. While some of them, like &#8211; <strong>Ubuntu, Linux Mint, and Elementary OS<\/strong> focus on simplicity, some like <strong>Tails<\/strong> focus on security.<\/p>\n<h2>How many Open Source Operating systems are there?<\/h2>\n<p>The answer is infinite. If you have enough technical and programming knowledge to understand the code of an Open Source Operating System, then you can also create one as per your or your company&#8217;s needs and sell it.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Pros and Cons of Open Source Operating Systems:<\/strong><\/h2>\n<h3><strong>Pros:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cost-efficient \u2013<\/strong> Most of the Open Source OS is free. And some of them are available at a very cheap rate than the commercial closed products.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Reliable and efficient \u2013<\/strong> Most of them are monitored by thousands of eyes since the source code is public. So if there is any vulnerability or bugs, they are fixed by the best developers around the world<\/li>\n<li><strong>Flexibility-<\/strong> The great advantage is you can customize it as per your need. And there is creative freedom.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><strong>Cons:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Security risk \u2013<\/strong> Though the bugs are identified, there is a risk of attacks as the source code is available to the attackers.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Complicated \u2013<\/strong> It is not user-friendly as the closed ones. You need to have the minimum technical knowledge to use this software<\/li>\n<li><strong>No support \u2013<\/strong> If you meet with the problem, then there is no customer support to help you out.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>So should I adopt Open Source Operating System?\u00a0<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Though the securities of the open-source software questionable, there is no guarantee on the proprietory OS. So, if you have enough technical knowledge or talents to understand the working of the Open Source Operating system, then you should go for it.<\/p>\n<p>In the end, it is all about sacrificing the user experience and security for higher performance, customization, and privacy.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\">Continue Reading:<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><em><strong><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/ipwithease.com\/what-is-operating-system-and-its-functions\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" style=\"color: #0000ff;\" target=\"_blank\">What is Operating System (OS) and Its Functions?<\/a><\/span><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p><em><strong><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/ipwithease.com\/what-is-distributed-operating-system-dos\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" style=\"color: #0000ff;\" target=\"_blank\">What is Distributed Operating System (DOS) ?<\/a><\/span><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>In case you are preparing for your next interview, then our e book on <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/ipwithease.com\/product\/operating-system-interview-qa\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" style=\"color: #0000ff;\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Operating System Interview Q&amp;A<\/strong><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p>would be really helpful for you.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ipwithease.com\/product\/operating-system-interview-qa\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Operating System\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-14015\" height=\"200\" src=\"https:\/\/ipwithease.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Operating-System.jpg\" width=\"168\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Fan-overview-on-open-source-operating-system%2F&amp;linkname=What%20is%20Open%20Source%20Operating%20system%3F\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Facebook\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Fan-overview-on-open-source-operating-system%2F&amp;linkname=What%20is%20Open%20Source%20Operating%20system%3F\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Twitter\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_linkedin\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Fan-overview-on-open-source-operating-system%2F&amp;linkname=What%20is%20Open%20Source%20Operating%20system%3F\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"LinkedIn\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_whatsapp\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/whatsapp?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Fan-overview-on-open-source-operating-system%2F&amp;linkname=What%20is%20Open%20Source%20Operating%20system%3F\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"WhatsApp\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_email\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Fan-overview-on-open-source-operating-system%2F&amp;linkname=What%20is%20Open%20Source%20Operating%20system%3F\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Email\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_reddit\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Fan-overview-on-open-source-operating-system%2F&amp;linkname=What%20is%20Open%20Source%20Operating%20system%3F\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Reddit\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_pinterest\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/pinterest?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Fan-overview-on-open-source-operating-system%2F&amp;linkname=What%20is%20Open%20Source%20Operating%20system%3F\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pinterest\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_counter addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Fan-overview-on-open-source-operating-system%2F&#038;title=What%20is%20Open%20Source%20Operating%20system%3F\"><\/a><\/p>"

Whaling Phishing is described as a digitally enabled fraud through social engineering, designed to encourage user victims to perform a secondary action, such as initiating a wire transfer of funds.<\/p>\n<p>Although Whaling Phishing does not require extensive technical knowledge, it has the advantage of delivering huge returns. This is one of the biggest risks that online business is facing at the moment. Financial organizations and payment services are the most targeted victims. Interestingly, cloud storage and file hosting sites, online services and e-commerce sites are receiving a huge share of attacks as well.<\/p>\n<p>The main strategy of Whaling Phishing emails is highly sophisticated compared to the generic phishing emails, because they often target chief (C-Level) executives and usually contain personalized information about the targeted organization or individual. These kind of emails may also convey a sense of urgency and are usually crafted with a solid understanding of business language and tone.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Whaling Phishing Techniques<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>As investigated by scientists and engineers and the following three techniques are mainly used:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Whaling Fishing Email with A Phone Call: <\/strong>There have been several incidents reported, where by a whaling phishing email was first received and then followed by a phone call that confirms the initial email request. This is mainly a social engineering technique which could be best described as cyber\u00a0enabled<em>\u00a0<\/em>fraud attack. In this case, the phone call serves the dual purpose of corroborating the email request and making the victim weak from a possible cyber-attack.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-15058 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/ipwithease.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/whaling-phishing-2.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Whaling Fishing Email from Malicious Actors: <\/strong>The increase of supply chain attacks (where a supplier or partner organization\u2019s network is compromised in order to gain access to the target area) has been well documented. However, recent whaling attacks have used easily accessible information on suppliers or partners to create whaling emails which look legitimate. If an organization advertises partners such as charities, law firms, policy institute or academic, they should be aware that they may receive emails from malicious actors disguised as the trusted partners.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-15060 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/ipwithease.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/whaling-phishing-3.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Whaling Fishing Email from Colleagues: <\/strong>In this case an employee\u2019s email address is either compromised (or a <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/networkinterview.com\/what-is-spoofing-detailed-explanation\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" style=\"color: #0000ff;\" target=\"_blank\">spoofed<\/a><\/span> email address is used) to convince other employees, that they are going to receive a legitimate request from a colleague. This is especially effective when the email address of a senior executive is spoofed to request an urgent payment for a junior member of (for example) a finance organization.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-15061 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/ipwithease.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/whaling-phishing-4.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Whaling Fishing through Social Media: <\/strong>Nowadays<strong>, <\/strong>Social media networks are being used increasingly for developing business contacts, recruiting employees and hosting conversations. However social media accounts, both professional and personal, provide a method for malicious actors to investigate and make contacts with senior executives. They provide a legitimate source of information for social engineering.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>Consequences of Whaling Phishing <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The two main disadvantages of being a victim of a Whale Phishing attack are the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Financial Loss: <\/strong>The Intelligence report by PhishLabs, reveals that 22% of whaling phishing attacks analyzed in 2015 were\u00a0motivated by financial frauds. As shown in the table below, there is an illustration of the top five of the largest financial losses to organizations, were from fishing emails. According to these examples, a senior executive received a fraudulent email request to transfer funds.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-15062 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/ipwithease.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/whaling-phishing-5.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Reputational Loss: <\/strong>Financial or data loss because of a whaling phishing attack can be extremely embarrassing to both an organization and an individual as well. FACC, an Austrian aerospace manufacturer, lost \u20ac50 million from a targeted whaling phishing email attack in 2016. Then he decided to\u00a0fire many employees including the CEO, for their involvement in the incident.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>Conclusion\u00a0<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The innovative and increasing use of the Internet, technology devices and smart cities have also presented huge opportunities to cybercriminal attacks. It is becoming imperative to balance, the use of the insecure Internet in our daily lives with new age devices.

Do you want to know more about it? Kindly follow the article.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>What is WannaCry Ransomware?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><strong>WannaCry<\/strong> is a type of Ransomware worm that affected many corporate and spread across Microsoft users in May 2017. Like other Crypto-Ransomware, it takes data hostages and demands a large sum of ransoms in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.<\/p>\n<p>Ransomware is malware that enters the computer and gets full access to the affected system. It demands a ransom from the user to let the system work again. The ransom can be in the money and other forms.<\/p>\n<p>When the ransomware encrypts the data in the PC and demands a ransom to release them, it is called Crypto-ransomware.\u00a0 WannaCry is one of them. <strong>The literal meaning of the word WannaCry is &#8211; &#8220;Want to decrypt?&#8221;<\/strong> \u00a0In the case of WannaCry ransomware, attackers demanded $300 &#8211; $600 as ransom in the form of Bitcoin.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>History of WannaCry Attack<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The first evidence of the attack was found in Asia on Friday, 12 May 2017. The ransomware infection spread rapidly between the networks of computers through Eternal Blue an exposed Vulnerability of Microsoft window. Within the day, the infection spread to more than 2, 30,000 computers in over 150 countries.<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately, Microsoft has already released a security patch for the Eternal Blue Exploit one month before the attack. Thus only those who didn&#8217;t update to the Microsoft new patch were affected by this attack.\u00a0 The attack was halted in the next four days by the cybersecurity peoples through new patches and the discovery of the kill switch.<\/p>\n<p>There were more than 3,00,000 infected computers and 2,00,000 victims. Many nations asserted North Korea or the agencies working for the country as the one behind the attack. But still today, the suspect remains anonymous and not arrested.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\"><strong>Related :<\/strong><\/span> <em><strong><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/ipwithease.com\/network-vulnerabilities-and-the-osi-model\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" style=\"color: #0000ff;\" target=\"_blank\">Network Vulnerabilities and the OSI Model<\/a><\/span><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<h2><strong>What is Eternal Blue Exploit?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><strong>Eternal Blue<\/strong> is a Cyber Vulnerability in the implementation of Server Message Block (SMB) of Microsoft Windows found by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA). Instead of reporting, they used it for their offensive purpose. Then, it was stolen and released by the mysterious hacker group named the shadow Brokers.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>How does it Work?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The hackers induce the WannaCry code through the Eternal Blue exploit. During the attack, the shadow brokers released a backdoor tool \u2013 Double Pulsar. It is a tool that helps to bypass the normal authentication and encryption of the computers.<\/p>\n<p>The WannaCry takes advantage of the already installed Double Pulsar or installs it, to access the information and grasp the control of the system. An interesting character about it is, it doesn&#8217;t reveal itself once it entered the computer. It dives deep inside to find the URL (<strong>so-called <a href=\"https:\/\/networkinterview.com\/what-is-a-kill-switch-in-vpn\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">&#8220;kill Switch&#8221;<\/span><\/a><\/strong>). Experts are unsure about the reason behind this function.<\/p>\n<p>If it cannot find it, then it starts to encrypt all the files on the computer. The files can be in any format (Microsoft files, Mp3, Mkv). When the user tries to access the file, it displays a ransom notice demanding $300 to $600 to release or regain the files.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Do WannaCry attacks still exist? <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><strong>Marcus Hutchins<\/strong>, the British Cybersecurity expert discovered the code&#8217;s search for the URL. His discovery of the kill switch reduced the spread of ransomware but didn&#8217;t stop it.\u00a0 On the other side, the patch for Eternal Blue exploit was released by the Microsoft team. These two factors brought the attack to end.<\/p>\n<p>However, in recent times we are facing a new variant of the Eternal Blue Exploit. In 2018, a new variant of WannaCry attacked the <strong>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC<\/strong>) forcing it to shut down its business. In that year, Boeing experienced the same. However, they were able to recover fast due to the availability of security patches.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>How to prevent yourself?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>As the WannCry make use of the same exploit, it shows there are still more computers that remain not patched. Though the WannCry targets only the windows, it is better to take the following prevention measures in all your electronic gadgets including phones, androids, and tablets.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keep your systems updated to the new version released by the vendor.<\/li>\n<li>Backup all your information, as the instance of getting back the data after the ransom is very low.<\/li>\n<li>Update all your security software to face the recent threats.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\">Continue Reading:<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><em><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/ipwithease.com\/blind-sql-injection-prevention-and-consequences\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" style=\"color: #0000ff;\" target=\"_blank\">Blind SQL Injection<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p><em><strong><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/ipwithease.com\/introduction-to-rainbow-table-cyber-attack\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" style=\"color: #0000ff;\" target=\"_blank\">Rainbow Table : Cyber Attack<\/a><\/span><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p><a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Fwannacry-ransomware-fully-explained%2F&amp;linkname=WannaCry%20Ransomware%20Fully%20Explained\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Facebook\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Fwannacry-ransomware-fully-explained%2F&amp;linkname=WannaCry%20Ransomware%20Fully%20Explained\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Twitter\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_linkedin\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Fwannacry-ransomware-fully-explained%2F&amp;linkname=WannaCry%20Ransomware%20Fully%20Explained\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"LinkedIn\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_whatsapp\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/whatsapp?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Fwannacry-ransomware-fully-explained%2F&amp;linkname=WannaCry%20Ransomware%20Fully%20Explained\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"WhatsApp\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_email\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Fwannacry-ransomware-fully-explained%2F&amp;linkname=WannaCry%20Ransomware%20Fully%20Explained\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Email\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_reddit\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Fwannacry-ransomware-fully-explained%2F&amp;linkname=WannaCry%20Ransomware%20Fully%20Explained\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Reddit\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_button_pinterest\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/add_to\/pinterest?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Fwannacry-ransomware-fully-explained%2F&amp;linkname=WannaCry%20Ransomware%20Fully%20Explained\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pinterest\"><\/a><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_counter addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https:\/\/www.addtoany.com\/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Fipwithease.com%2Fwannacry-ransomware-fully-explained%2F&#038;title=WannaCry%20Ransomware%20Fully%20Explained\"><\/a><\/p>"

This is actually the second time in less than 6 months that this same fiber ring has had an extended power outage. The other time was for a blown transformer or something of that nature.

Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and related technologies like SD-WAN, SASE, etc., are bringing capability to control the network securely by programming the routing packets as per requirement without changing the network hardware. Such new networking technologies give huge power to network administrators. Enterprises using these technologies are realizing business benefits along with capital expenditure (CapEx) savings to connect global business networks. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\" xml:lang=\"EN\"><span>But leaders still need to understand the exact outcome to shift away from legacy networks that potentially yield central management of networks while saving money. Enterprise CIOs are looking for the advantages that innovations in the network will deliver. They seek to become future-ready to handle vast amounts of digital data. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\" xml:lang=\"EN\"><span>Let us discuss some of the key factors which are driving network modernization. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><b><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 14.0pt;\" xml:lang=\"EN\"><span>Simplification<\/span><\/span><\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\" xml:lang=\"EN\"><span>In this modern era, end-devices or users ask for agile services delivery and rapid transaction of data from the server. To address this, enterprise networks need simplification in terms of routing data to exact users with the right policies applied to it and make sure the different set of end-users get data or network services they want in a short period of time. With technologies like SDN and Network Functions Virtualization (NFV), it is now possible to control the network infrastructure by replacing most of the network components and achieving a high level of zero-touch automation and provisioning. Using such technologies, enterprises can also reduce the CapEx and reduce the power consumption required in the network. With new software-based and software-driven technologies in hand, it is also replacing legacy networks that can route traffic based on congestion patterns at some part of the network. You get end-to-end visibility in your network that can help you in managing the network bandwidth and identify the network glitches that also can be fixed remotely. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><b><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 14.0pt;\" xml:lang=\"EN\"><span>Cloud-ready<\/span><\/span><\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\" xml:lang=\"EN\"><span>Most enterprises are adopting cloud as a part of digital initiatives. Legacy networks are not enough to match the agility required by cloud services. The services are configured either within the internal private cloud or subscribed from public cloud. A new model of hybrid, as well as multi-cloud, is also making into enterprise infrastructure to take advantage of benefits offered from different clouds and optimize the cost of business services. It is high time where enterprise CIO will want the network to fit into the cloud equation so that it is possible for cloud applications to run on the network and delivered to end-users with optimal performance. There are various new solutions that have emerged that also give network visibility when enterprises implement hybrid and multi-cloud so that they can manage cloud applications that reside in different clouds with ease. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><b><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 14.0pt;\" xml:lang=\"EN\"><span>Lowering the cost<\/span><\/span><\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\" xml:lang=\"EN\"><span>Legacy network was architected using proprietary hardware equipment to perform designated network functions that required manual configuration to get functional. Also, manual efforts were required in case of network glitches and upgrade of hardware to better performance. Modern networks are software-based such as virtual network functions (VNFs), and programmed to operate automatically using open-source technologies (OpenDaylight, ONOS, Tungsten Fabric, OPNFV, and more). Now, it is possible to diagnose and upgrade a network with a single pane of glass as most part of the network is software-driven and software components that are interconnected using APIs.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><b><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 14.0pt;\" xml:lang=\"EN\"><span>Support for high streaming data<\/span><\/span><\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\" xml:lang=\"EN\"><span>Typically, a normal user uses the VPNs to access the different channels.

Due to pandemic, remote working has become a norm, and we have seen an increase in video streaming in the form of live webinars, video calls, and video demos. Traditionally, Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP) is used for the speedy delivery of video streams over the network. But modern networks require protocols to support low latency streaming. In this case, HTTP-based protocols are being used, for example, Apple HLS (HTTP Live Streaming), Low-Latency HLS, Low-Latency CMAF for DASH (Common Media Application Format for DASH), MPEG-DASH (Moving Picture Expert Group Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP). VPNs are commonly used by enterprises to connect to internal networks, and it is recommended to use secure communication. But modern networks are developed to get over VPNs with the proper use of technologies like SD-WAN. It is important to ensure the support for secure video streaming using such new technologies.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>",

Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and related technologies like SD-WAN, SASE, etc., are bringing capability to control the network securely by programming the routing packets as per requirement without changing the network hardware. Such new networking technologies give huge power to network administrators. Enterprises using these technologies are realizing business benefits along with capital expenditure (CapEx) savings to connect global business networks. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\" xml:lang=\"EN\"><span>But leaders still need to understand the exact outcome to shift away from legacy networks that potentially yield central management of networks while saving money. Enterprise CIOs are looking for the advantages that innovations in the network will deliver. They seek to become future-ready to handle vast amounts of digital data. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\" xml:lang=\"EN\"><span>Let us discuss some of the key factors which are driving network modernization. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><b><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 14.0pt;\" xml:lang=\"EN\"><span>Simplification<\/span><\/span><\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\" xml:lang=\"EN\"><span>In this modern era, end-devices or users ask for agile services delivery and rapid transaction of data from the server. To address this, enterprise networks need simplification in terms of routing data to exact users with the right policies applied to it and make sure the different set of end-users get data or network services they want in a short period of time. With technologies like SDN and Network Functions Virtualization (NFV), it is now possible to control the network infrastructure by replacing most of the network components and achieving a high level of zero-touch automation and provisioning. Using such technologies, enterprises can also reduce the CapEx and reduce the power consumption required in the network. With new software-based and software-driven technologies in hand, it is also replacing legacy networks that can route traffic based on congestion patterns at some part of the network. You get end-to-end visibility in your network that can help you in managing the network bandwidth and identify the network glitches that also can be fixed remotely. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><b><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 14.0pt;\" xml:lang=\"EN\"><span>Cloud-ready<\/span><\/span><\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\" xml:lang=\"EN\"><span>Most enterprises are adopting cloud as a part of digital initiatives. Legacy networks are not enough to match the agility required by cloud services. The services are configured either within the internal private cloud or subscribed from public cloud. A new model of hybrid, as well as multi-cloud, is also making into enterprise infrastructure to take advantage of benefits offered from different clouds and optimize the cost of business services. It is high time where enterprise CIO will want the network to fit into the cloud equation so that it is possible for cloud applications to run on the network and delivered to end-users with optimal performance. There are various new solutions that have emerged that also give network visibility when enterprises implement hybrid and multi-cloud so that they can manage cloud applications that reside in different clouds with ease. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><b><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 14.0pt;\" xml:lang=\"EN\"><span>Lowering the cost<\/span><\/span><\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\" xml:lang=\"EN\"><span>Legacy network was architected using proprietary hardware equipment to perform designated network functions that required manual configuration to get functional. Also, manual efforts were required in case of network glitches and upgrade of hardware to better performance. Modern networks are software-based such as virtual network functions (VNFs), and programmed to operate automatically using open-source technologies (OpenDaylight, ONOS, Tungsten Fabric, OPNFV, and more). Now, it is possible to diagnose and upgrade a network with a single pane of glass as most part of the network is software-driven and software components that are interconnected using APIs.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><b><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 14.0pt;\" xml:lang=\"EN\"><span>Support for high streaming data<\/span><\/span><\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\" xml:lang=\"EN\"><span>Typically, a normal user uses the VPNs to access the different channels. For example, to access Roku, they <\/span><\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/cooltechzone.com\/roku-vpn\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span><span style=\"color: #1155cc;\">set up a VPN list<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/a><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\" xml:lang=\"EN\"><span> so that they can easily connect privately to access the video streaming. Due to pandemic, remote working has become a norm, and we have seen an increase in video streaming in the form of live webinars, video calls, and video demos. Traditionally, Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP) is used for the speedy delivery of video streams over the network. But modern networks require protocols to support low latency streaming. In this case, HTTP-based protocols are being used, for example, Apple HLS (HTTP Live Streaming), Low-Latency HLS, Low-Latency CMAF for DASH (Common Media Application Format for DASH), MPEG-DASH (Moving Picture Expert Group Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP). VPNs are commonly used by enterprises to connect to internal networks, and it is recommended to use secure communication. But modern networks are developed to get over VPNs with the proper use of technologies like SD-WAN. It is important to ensure the support for secure video streaming using such new technologies.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>"

At the heart of this vision is infrastructure built atop a robust ecosystem of integrated devices and network sensors capable of translating data analytics in real-time to optimize everything from the electrical grid and water utilities via smart meters to traffic flows and public safety through vehicle-to-infrastructure communication.<\/p>\n<p>Unlocking the potential of smart cities requires network enhancements like low latency, reliable coverage, and a substantial increase in capacity for more connected IoT devices to come online \u2013 and in higher densities.

Currently, however, most warehouse robotics, like autonomous guided vehicles (AGVs), are constrained by wired ethernet or Wi-Fi connections that are slow, cumbersome, and prone to disruption amid dense factory settings.<\/p>\n<p>With most factories and warehouse operations located outside of city centers and major metropolitan areas, the broader coverage range offered by C-band in comparison to mmWave will ensure that 5G is accessible and reliable enough to have a substantial impact on the manufacturing sector. By increasing data transfer speeds from 100Mbps to 500Mbps, C-band spectrum will play a crucial role in enhancing throughput and productivity while greatly expanding the bandwidth and capacity necessary to accommodate the growing number of IoT devices at the heart of the smart factory.<\/p>\n<p><b><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height: 107%;\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">Making the 5G revolution a reality <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<p>From its inception, 5G has been touted as nothing short of revolutionary.

C-band is well-positioned to significantly increase network speed while offering the signal continuity necessary to support the dense interconnectivity needed to ensure the possibilities of smart city initiatives are realized \u2013 and live up to the promise of reshaping the citizen experience.<\/p>\n<p><b><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height: 107%;\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">Warehouse robotics and factory automation<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<p>From machine learning and robotic automation to real-time data analytics for inventory management and process implementation, the concept of Industry 4.0, or the Fourth Industrial Revolution, has long been touted as the key to unlocking unparalleled levels of efficiency and precision. Currently, however, most warehouse robotics, like autonomous guided vehicles (AGVs), are constrained by wired ethernet or Wi-Fi connections that are slow, cumbersome, and prone to disruption amid dense factory settings.<\/p>\n<p>With most factories and warehouse operations located outside of city centers and major metropolitan areas, the broader coverage range offered by C-band in comparison to mmWave will ensure that 5G is accessible and reliable enough to have a substantial impact on the manufacturing sector. By increasing data transfer speeds from 100Mbps to 500Mbps, C-band spectrum will play a crucial role in enhancing throughput and productivity while greatly expanding the bandwidth and capacity necessary to accommodate the growing number of IoT devices at the heart of the smart factory.<\/p>\n<p><b><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height: 107%;\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">Making the 5G revolution a reality <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<p>From its inception, 5G has been touted as nothing short of revolutionary. By now, the associations and tropes are familiar: unparalleled connectivity, breakneck speeds, and latency low enough for the realization of everything from self-driving cars to remote surgeries. Not surprisingly, 5G has become a victim of its own hype-cycle, focused on the potentiality and possibility of a connected future to come, without attending to just how far we might be from realizing that future given the substantial infrastructure and investment challenges obstructing the path forward.<\/p>\n<p>And yet, as a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mckinsey.com\/~\/media\/mckinsey\/industries\/technology%20media%20and%20telecommunications\/telecommunications\/our%20insights\/connected%20world%20an%20evolution%20in%20connectivity%20beyond%20the%205g%20revolution\/mgi_connected-world_discussion-paper_february-2020.ashx\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: #0563c1;\">recent report by McKinsey put it<\/span><\/a>, \"the future is not solely happening on the frontier. Existing connectivity technologies are expanding and evolving, with new standards that boost network performance\u2014and they are much less capital-intensive.\" To be sure, this is exactly what the wide availability of C-band spectrum provides. The possibility of a 5G network that can offer substantial benefits and improvements precisely because it occupies that critical space on the long road to innovation \u2013 one that builds on the infrastructure of the past to shorten the distance from our present to the horizon of possibility up ahead.<\/p>\n<p>While we won't know the winners of the C-Band auction for several weeks, it's already clear that regardless of which service providers snag the largest swaths of this highly coveted mid-band spectrum, we all stand to benefit.<\/p>\n<p><i>Raj Radjassamy is Director, 5G Wireless Segment for <a href=\"https:\/\/electrification.us.abb.com\/?utm_source=networkcomputing&amp;utm_medium=byline&amp;utm_campaign=cbandauction\" target=\"_blank\">ABB Power Conversion<\/a><\/i><i>.<\/i><\/p>"

Comparing network slicing to traditional QoS that already exists on the corporate LAN, WAN, and WLAN, slicing is superior in two specific ways. First, the types of traffic flows that are placed into virtual network slice groups can be configured to be highly granular. For example, while traffic for an individual application can be placed into a network slice group, that same traffic can be further segmented to only allow network application flows from specific source and\/or destination devices. This level of granularity is difficult, if not impossible, to achieve and maintain using traditional QoS methods.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, because network slicing creates a multiplexed virtual network from end-to-end and since 5G wireless allows for complete infrastructure control for traffic transmission scheduling on connected devices, a proper service level agreement (SLA) policy can be imposed across the network slice to guarantee throughput and latency performance numbers.

We remain enthusiastic about the 5G opportunity and look forward to being a key part of making every band from 600MHz to 71GHz work to its utmost for the sake of a society with better communications.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><i><span style=\"color: black;\">Roger Nichols is 5G Program Manager at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.keysight.com\/us\/en\/home.html\" target=\"_blank\">Keysight Technologies<\/a>.<\/span><\/i><\/p>"

But how do you know when theres a black hole router in between? My guess would be that in that case the sent packet is never acknowledged and since there is never an ICMP message one can conclude that there has to be a black hole router in between the source and destination. Am I correct?<\/p>"

The communications are IEC104 protocol which use TCP\/IP.\nThe IEC104 protocol have its hown numbering mecanism. So when an IEC104 message (APDU) is lost it is detected.<\/p>\n\n<p>The problem we have is that, sometimes, IEC104 APDU comming from the RTU are lost (hole in the numbering) but the underlying TCP sequence number is correct. I analyzed this with wireshark.<\/p>\n\n<p>The connection is going trough several routers and firewalls and radio. NAT is also used at one point. <\/p>\n\n<p>I'm trying to find out if the problem is in the RTU or in the network.<\/p>\n\n<p>My understanding of the TCP protocol is that it does a check end-to-end. The paquets are numbered on each end of the connection and acknowledge also on each end. If this is the case then the problem is in the RTU and the IEC104 numbering.<\/p>\n\n<p>Am I wrong? Is there cases where equipements on the network (routers, firewalls with NAT) could renumber the TCP sequence? If this is the case then the problem would be in the network.\nIn my opinion it is not the case because routers, firewalls work on layer 3 (network\/IP). It should not touch the TCP layer...but I'm not up to date with the latest inovations :) <\/p>\n\n<p>Could some specialist give their advice? <\/p>\n\n<p>Thanks<\/p>\n\n<p>Alex<\/p>",

The communications are IEC104 protocol which use TCP\/IP.\nThe IEC104 protocol have its hown numbering mecanism. So when an IEC104 message (APDU) is lost it is detected.<\/p>\n\n<p>The problem we have is that, sometimes, IEC104 APDU comming from the RTU are lost (hole in the numbering) but the underlying TCP sequence number is correct. I analyzed this with wireshark.<\/p>\n\n<p>The connection is going trough several routers and firewalls and radio. NAT is also used at one point. <\/p>\n\n<p>I'm trying to find out if the problem is in the RTU or in the network.<\/p>\n\n<p>My understanding of the TCP protocol is that it does a check end-to-end. The paquets are numbered on each end of the connection and acknowledge also on each end. If this is the case then the problem is in the RTU and the IEC104 numbering.<\/p>\n\n<p>Am I wrong? Is there cases where equipements on the network (routers, firewalls with NAT) could renumber the TCP sequence? If this is the case then the problem would be in the network.\nIn my opinion it is not the case because routers, firewalls work on layer 3 (network\/IP). It should not touch the TCP layer...but I'm not up to date with the latest inovations :) <\/p>\n\n<p>Could some specialist give their advice? <\/p>\n\n<p>Thanks<\/p>\n\n<p>Alex<\/p>"

As we wrap up our look at advanced OSPF topics, we'll discuss default routes, and compare OSPFv2 with OSPFv3.<\/p>\n<h2>Default Routes<\/h2>\n<p>We have seen where OSPF can automatically generate a default route when needed. This occurs with some of our special area types. For example, of you configure a totally stubby area, of course a default route is required and OSPF generates this route automatically from the ABR.<\/p>\n<p>In order to increase flexibility with your designs, default routes injected into a normal area can be originated by any OSPF router. To generate a default route, you use the <strong>default-information originate&nbsp;<\/strong>command.<\/p>\n<p>This command presents two options:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can advertise 0.0.0.0 into the OSPF domain, provided the advertising router already has a default route.<\/li>\n<li>You can advertise 0.0.0.0 regardless of whether the advertising router already has a default route.

This is the job of OSPFv3. The great news for you is the fact that you can leverage almost everything you have learned about OSPFv2 when transitioning to the OSPFv3 protocol. There was not a complete redesign of the protocol, and as much functionality and configuration steps were maintained as possible.<\/p>\n<p>As you will learn in this section, OSPFv3 offers the use of address families in the configuration, making this protocol suited for carrying IPv6 prefixes, or even IPv4 prefixes with the appropriate address family.<\/p>\n<p>For the sake of completion, this section demonstrates the &ldquo;standard&rdquo; configuration of OSPFv3, as well as the address family configuration.<\/p>\n<p>It is fun, and important, to distinguish the key similarities and differences between v2 and v3 of the OSPF protocols.&nbsp;Here are the similarities that jump off the page:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>In OSPFv3, a routing process does not need to be explicitly created. Enabling OSPFv3 on an interface will cause a routing process and its associated configuration to be created.<\/li>\n<li>The router ID is still a 32-bit value in OSPFv3 and the process of router ID selection is the same. OSPF automatically prefers a loopback interface over any other kind, and it chooses the highest IP address among all loopback interfaces. If no loopback interfaces are present, the highest IP address in the device is chosen.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Here are some key differences:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>In OSPFv3, each interface must be enabled using commands in interface configuration mode. This feature is different from OSPF version 2, in which interfaces are indirectly enabled using the device configuration mode.<\/li>\n<li>When using a nonbroadcast multiaccess interface in OSPFv3, you must manually configure the device with the list of neighbors. Neighboring devices are identified by their device ID.<\/li>\n<li>In IPv6, you can configure many address prefixes on an interface. In OSPFv3, all address prefixes on an interface are included by default. You cannot select some address prefixes to be imported into OSPFv3; either all address prefixes on an interface are imported, or no address prefixes on an interface are imported.<\/li>\n<li>Unlike OSPF version 2, multiple instances of OSPFv3 can be run on a link.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Traditional OSPFv3 Configuration<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In order to demonstrate (and practice) the OSPFv3 configuration, lets drop such a topology in right alongside the existing IPv4 topology that we have.<\/p>\n<p>Here is the configuration of our backbone area (Area 0) and non-backbone area (Area 1) using the &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; OSPFv3 approach.<\/p>\n<p><img height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net\/kajabi-storefronts-production\/blogs\/3184\/images\/Lw0jVLD3RMSOjg66CTQA_Screen_Shot_2019-07-08_at_2.58.32_PM.png\" width=\"603\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Note how familiar this configuration approach seems, especially if you are a fan of the interface-level approach to configuring OSPFv2.

This is a simple configuration change. On each device in the area, we need to set the Area 1 as stub. Here is the configuration in our network:<\/p>\n<p><img height=\"334\" src=\"https:\/\/kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net\/kajabi-storefronts-production\/blogs\/3184\/images\/8NPcEFVIQPma5FnX8vTg_Screen_Shot_2019-07-08_at_2.06.12_PM.png\" width=\"603\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This will cause a reset of the adjacency (as you might guess). After this change, it is time to check the OSPF route table and the OSPF database on ORL:<\/p>\n<p><img height=\"624\" src=\"https:\/\/kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net\/kajabi-storefronts-production\/blogs\/3184\/images\/U3iTvSgLTpqaI2cTJNbg_Screen_Shot_2019-07-08_at_2.07.25_PM.png\" width=\"601\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Just as we would hope, the routing table is smaller now! There is no longer the detail of the external prefixes from the ASBR. Instead we have a default route automatically generated by the ABR. This default route is needed, of course, because the routers in Area 1 still need to be able to access the remote prefixes (if needed).<\/p>\n<p>Now it is time to examine the OSPF database. It is exactly what we would expect to see in a stub area:<\/p>\n<p><img height=\"447\" src=\"https:\/\/kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net\/kajabi-storefronts-production\/blogs\/3184\/images\/MAUNV3gpRTmLpfASDHmg_Screen_Shot_2019-07-08_at_2.08.15_PM.png\" width=\"604\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The Type 4 and the Type 5 LSAs are filtered and there is now a Type 3 for the default route.<\/p>\n<h2>Totally Stubby Area<\/h2>\n<p>If we want to be more even more efficient in this example, we can convert Area 1 to a totally stubby area. This will eliminate the Type 3 LSAs that are used to advertise the Loopback 0 on ATL and the link between ATL and ATL2. There will still be a default route advertised, of course, because now it is needed more than ever! Here is the configuration and verification:<\/p>\n<p><img height=\"155\" src=\"https:\/\/kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net\/kajabi-storefronts-production\/blogs\/3184\/images\/10mJF1JPRwKpuqWAGCDJ_Screen_Shot_2019-07-08_at_2.09.50_PM.png\" width=\"603\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img height=\"447\" src=\"https:\/\/kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net\/kajabi-storefronts-production\/blogs\/3184\/images\/oYXMAqy8T2G6aAaCS0t7_Screen_Shot_2019-07-08_at_2.10.42_PM.png\" width=\"602\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img height=\"409\" src=\"https:\/\/kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net\/kajabi-storefronts-production\/blogs\/3184\/images\/XDFY4QH8Ra1S2BHyXVXQ_Screen_Shot_2019-07-08_at_2.11.28_PM.png\" width=\"603\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Not So Stubby Area (NSSA)<\/h2>\n<p>If you need to bring in external prefixes to a stub area, you must make it a Not So Stubby Area (NSSA). This permits the external prefixes to be carried through the stub area as Type 7 LSAs. The ABR then converts them to Type 5 for propagation through the OSPF domain (potentially).<\/p>\n<p>Here is the configuration in our scenario:<\/p>\n<p><img height=\"182\" src=\"https:\/\/kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net\/kajabi-storefronts-production\/blogs\/3184\/images\/8Pf8KtteRHO892NjZXUX_Screen_Shot_2019-07-08_at_2.13.10_PM.png\" width=\"604\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img height=\"257\" src=\"https:\/\/kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net\/kajabi-storefronts-production\/blogs\/3184\/images\/Vkdr08pEQJCqSF3Ne0Ac_Screen_Shot_2019-07-08_at_2.14.00_PM.png\" width=\"601\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img height=\"205\" src=\"https:\/\/kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net\/kajabi-storefronts-production\/blogs\/3184\/images\/Cx9MWw5cR4i1SnawRVnV_Screen_Shot_2019-07-08_at_2.14.49_PM.png\" width=\"603\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This should prove to be some interesting verification for sure. Let&rsquo;s begin by examining the OSPF routes and the OSPF database on ORL:<\/p>\n<p><img height=\"550\" src=\"https:\/\/kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net\/kajabi-storefronts-production\/blogs\/3184\/images\/d7nNlynFStOimT3y7vhB_Screen_Shot_2019-07-08_at_2.16.21_PM.png\" width=\"604\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<img height=\"549\" src=\"https:\/\/kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net\/kajabi-storefronts-production\/blogs\/3184\/images\/oM234UaQHWkKOQ5tQT8w_Screen_Shot_2019-07-08_at_2.17.20_PM.png\" width=\"603\" \/><\/p>\n<p>We can see from the routing table that we are learning the Type 3 advertisements again from Area 0 (1.1.1.1 and 10.12.12.0). The OSPF database proves the NSSA works as advertised at this point. We can see the external prefixes brought in to Area 1 as Type 7 in the database. Let&rsquo;s quickly check over on ATL to see if they appear there as Type 5 LSAs as we would expect.<\/p>\n<p><img height=\"600\" src=\"https:\/\/kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net\/kajabi-storefronts-production\/blogs\/3184\/images\/9tNoVgMRym0pk7gnEpgw_Screen_Shot_2019-07-08_at_2.18.14_PM.png\" width=\"603\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img height=\"531\" src=\"https:\/\/kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net\/kajabi-storefronts-production\/blogs\/3184\/images\/778R3UquSaGOvkLKcxjY_Screen_Shot_2019-07-08_at_2.19.15_PM.png\" width=\"603\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Yes, the output makes sense for our understanding of how the NSSA works. The prefixes are there as Type 5s and we see this in the routing table as well.<\/p>\n<p>NOTE: The NSSA area does not feature a dynamically generated default route without you configuring that feature. So, in our network above, we would not have full reachability!

The OSPF database proves the NSSA works as advertised at this point. We can see the external prefixes brought in to Area 1 as Type 7 in the database. Let&rsquo;s quickly check over on ATL to see if they appear there as Type 5 LSAs as we would expect.<\/p>\n<p><img height=\"600\" src=\"https:\/\/kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net\/kajabi-storefronts-production\/blogs\/3184\/images\/9tNoVgMRym0pk7gnEpgw_Screen_Shot_2019-07-08_at_2.18.14_PM.png\" width=\"603\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img height=\"531\" src=\"https:\/\/kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net\/kajabi-storefronts-production\/blogs\/3184\/images\/778R3UquSaGOvkLKcxjY_Screen_Shot_2019-07-08_at_2.19.15_PM.png\" width=\"603\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Yes, the output makes sense for our understanding of how the NSSA works.

This changes the network type from the loopback type for OSPF and causes the mask to advertise as it is configured.<\/p>\n<p>Now it is time to add to the story here. Let&rsquo;s configure some external prefixes and inject them into the OSPF domain. This is simple thanks to loopback interfaces. We will create some on the ATL router, run EIGRP on them, and then redistribute them into OSPF.<\/p>\n<p><img height=\"335\" src=\"https:\/\/kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net\/kajabi-storefronts-production\/blogs\/3184\/images\/D8RfcruaRMWQtgzOjdvZ_Screen_Shot_2019-07-08_at_1.55.29_PM.png\" width=\"602\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Now we have even more interesting verifications on the ORL device. First, the routing table:<\/p>\n<p><img height=\"601\" src=\"https:\/\/kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net\/kajabi-storefronts-production\/blogs\/3184\/images\/uLEyi76WTVCpnxkdhrY1_Screen_Shot_2019-07-08_at_1.56.30_PM.png\" width=\"602\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Notice how the remote prefixes are listed as E2 routes. This is the default of Type 2 external OSPF routes. It means that the metric is unchanged as the prefix flows from the ASBR (Autonomous System Boundary Router) to the internal OSPF speaker. You can change the type to Type 1 if you desire when you are performing resitrubution.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps of more interest is the OSPF database:<\/p>\n<p><img height=\"661\" src=\"https:\/\/kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net\/kajabi-storefronts-production\/blogs\/3184\/images\/7Nbb1tCRRcyh0WJTB5t4_Screen_Shot_2019-07-08_at_1.57.36_PM.png\" width=\"603\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Notice now we pick up the Type 4 LSA (summary ASB link state) which is the router ID (1.1.1.1) of the ASBR (ATL). We also get the Type 5 LSAs that are the external prefixes.<\/p>\n<p>That's going to wrap up the first part of our advanced OSPF blog series. Next time, we'll take a look at creating <em>stubby areas<\/em>, <em>totally stubby areas<\/em>, <em>not so stubby areas (NSSA),<\/em>&nbsp;and <em>totally NSSA<\/em>.<em>&nbsp;<\/em>Until then, take good care.<\/p>"

Here\u2019s why that matters:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Data Security<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span>Extreme Networks takes threats to the availability, integrity, and confidentiality of our clients\u2019 information seriously. <\/span><span>We are the first major cloud-networking vendor to attain ISO\/IEC 27001 certification for its Information Security Management Systems (ISMS) with ExtremeCloud IQ, in addition to <\/span><span>international compliance\/data privacy compliance<span>. This certification sits on top of the standard cloud security procedures put in place by the major cloud infrastructure vendors in the market: Google, AWS, Microsoft, etc. These include business continuity and disaster recovery processes, comprehensive controls, and facility monitoring. Extreme takes additional measures to secure cloud-based applications with geographically distributed data centers, including firewalling, continuous threat monitoring, DDOS prevention, daily backup, penetration testing, DevOps activity audits, and much more. Our data security has been <\/span>proven in the most risk-sensitive environments, which guarantees IT staff can spend l<span>ess time focusing on security and more time for other business issues and needs.<\/span> Our <span>automatic compliance validation minimizes any time-consuming, manual compliance work, and the visibility of all applications, users, and devices enables IT to efficiently monitor the entire network. The extra steps we take to ensure customer data security means more peace of mind for network administrators, reduced risk, and enhanced customer experience.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Data Durability<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span>When it comes to durability, it\u2019s about the health and resiliency of your data. Data loss and data corruption can happen in any number of ways\u2014this can lead to negative user experience, missed business goals, and ultimately decreased ROI and performance. Extreme goes to great lengths to maintain data durability. <\/span><span>We capture and securely store daily backups of customer configuration data and uploaded files.<\/span><span> Our <\/span><span>dedicated DevOps team performs complete system monitoring for our Cloud Services platform, including monitoring service levels, production capacity, usage, and trends. Performance snapshots are taken of running systems and will raise alarms if thresholds for the respective performance metrics are exceeded. This means that you will be able to access your data when you need it\u2014 to make networking and business decisions, and support your users.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Data Availability<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span>Great \u2013 we\u2019ve stored your data safely and securely. And now you need to know you can access it\u2026anytime. <\/span><span>Our software-defined, out-of-band management approach separates operational tasks (provisioning, reporting, monitoring, etc.) from client data.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>Real-time functions, including client data forwarding, firewall enforcement, and authentication, are handled directly by Extreme Networks access points, switches, and routers at the <em>edge<\/em> of the network with no dependence on network management or cloud accessibility. By decoupling management, data, and control planes, access networks receive increased efficiency, scale, and resiliency when compared to legacy systems that depend on network controllers.\u00a0<\/span><span>This means a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.extremenetworks.com\/extreme-networks-blog\/no-nines-uptime\/\"><span>NO NINES uptime<\/span><\/a><span> (100% uptime excluding scheduled maintenance windows); connectivity does not impact network operations servicing end-users<em><span>,<\/span><\/em><span> and it ensures the <\/span>most up-to-date technology to keep the network running as efficiently as it can. <\/span><span>But it\u2019s just not about current data \u2013 access to historical data can generate incredible insight, and we understand this as well. <\/span><span>Our\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.extremenetworks.com\/extremecloud-iq\/\"><span>ExtremeCloud IQ solution<\/span><\/a><span> offers the industry\u2019s\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/investor.extremenetworks.com\/news-releases\/news-release-details\/extreme-first-networking-company-offer-unlimited-data#:~:text=SAN%20JOSE%2C%20Calif.%2C%20May,the%20lifetime%20of%20their%20subscriptions.\"><span>first unlimited data plan,<\/span><\/a><span>\u00a0which provides our customers access to their entire historical data sets throughout their service agreement.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Ultimately, harnessing data leads to more informed decision-making, optimized operations, and enhanced customer experiences.

Tom also uses the wayfinding application in the lobby that helps him navigate to the department where his procedure will take place. In the mean time a nurse prepares his room, including making sure the appropriate equipment is in place to transport Tom and monitor his vitals post-procedure \u2013 all of which she is able to track down through a digital asset management application on a tablet connected to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.extremenetworks.com\/products\/extremewireless\/\">health center\u2019s Wi-Fi network<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>During the procedure, Tom\u2019s surgeon brings in two remote medical students to follow the process in real-time via the telehealth platform \u2013 it\u2019s a great educational experience.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>He also includes one of his colleagues to provide support should any complications arise.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>Fortunately, the process goes smoothly and Tom is quickly resting in his recovery room, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.extremenetworks.com\/solution\/internet-of-things\/\">connected to a series of sensors<\/a> that monitor his vitals and report back to a central nursing station.<\/p>\n<p>When Tom wakes, he is able to turn on his in-room entertainment system to watch his favorite season of The Office, submit his order for lunch, and call the nurse for some pain medication.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>He is also able to connect to the guest Wi-Fi to video chat his family and friends and let them know he is doing well and will be home later that day \u2013 and to post on social media what a great experience he had thanks to the innovative technology that made what could have been a long and frustrating experience smooth and seamless.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Home Recovery<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Because there is still some risk for a few weeks, Tom is equipped with a medical-grade wearable monitor to record his vitals and automatically transmit them into his EHR.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>Individualized thresholds are set by the doctor to alert the medical staff of any abnormalities as he recovers.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>He also has a mobile app he will use twice daily to report his pain level and any other symptoms.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>The same app reminds him when to take his medication, which the doctor prescribed easily through the telehealth platform for pick-up at Tom\u2019s local pharmacy on the way home.<span>\u00a0 <\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Follow-up Care<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A few days later, Tom\u2019s doctor checks in with him through the telehealth app to make sure he is feeling better and not exhibiting any of the previous symptoms.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>The digital interaction uses a speech recognition engine to transcribe the conversation and append it to Tom\u2019s EHR.<span>\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>At the end of the recovery period, there are no complications and Tom is feeling much better.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>When he thinks back on it, the entire process was simple, and every interaction and every data point was recorded in his digital record for future access.<span>\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Tom\u2019s experience is a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.extremenetworks.com\/solution\/healthcare\/\">model for healthcare providers<\/a> everywhere, driven by digital tools, automated systems, and efficient processes.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>Digital healthcare solutions like that are being implemented in healthcare systems across the world to drive better care and outcomes.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>They represent a major shift in healthcare culture that is being driven by three technology trends.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><span><span><\/span><\/span><\/span><span>Cloud \u2013 <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/learn.extremenetworks.com\/Gartner-Healthcare-Provider-CIO-Create-Your-Cloud-Strategy-in-2020.html\"><span>Cloud technology<\/span><\/a><span> is at the center of making Tom\u2019s entire experience possible.

        "value": "<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.walkercountyschools.com\/\">Walker County Board of Education<\/a> is located in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains in Alabama. Walker County\u2019s district consists of 16 schools and over 7,500 students in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.extremenetworks.com\/solution\/k-12-education\/\">grades K-12<\/a> with more than 900 employees. Walker County Board of Education\u2019s goal has always been to foster an education environment that provides students the tools they need to be successful in today\u2019s world. The ongoing global pandemic has created an entirely new set of challenges. Admits the pandemic schools all over the globe needed to develop technology-driven learning environments in order to follow health and safety guidelines while still maintain a high-quality educational environment for its students. In order to do just that WCBoE needed a digital transformation that would allow them to adapt fast.<\/p>\n<p>When the pandemic struck, and students were sent home, the challenges began to arise. Many students were left to work off of paper packets because the district only had about 2,500 Chromebooks to give out. The Board of Education has planned to implement in stages, but COVID-19 forced its hand. Luckily, the school district received some Federal funding and the district was able to purchase an additional 5,000 devices which would support the student population before the new school year began. For Patrick Gann, Technology Director for Walker County BoE, and his team of four other IT techs, that included procuring and setting up thousands of new digital devices for students to ensure all students would have access to the same content and experiences<\/p>\n<p>A bigger underlying challenge arose according to Gann, the existing network infrastructure and tools weren\u2019t capable of supporting more than 8,000 students and staff accessing network resources during the course of each school day, along with various other connected devices. Other connected devices such as digital learning devices like Promethean boards, Viewsonic panel displays, and digital learning applications, as well as surveillance systems, printers, HVAC systems, and more.\u00a0 Along with users in three additional facilities, including the central office, transportation building, and a storage facility. The current <a href=\"https:\/\/www.extremenetworks.com\/e-rate-resource-center\/\">Extreme Networks<\/a> 1 gig switches wouldn\u2019t be able to handle the network load, the district quickly pivoted and developed a plan to upgrade to a next generation infrastructure from Extreme.<\/p>\n<p>Patrick Gann, Technology Director for Walker County BoE explained \u201cThe biggest challenge was being able to view everything on the network and making sure all the switches and VLANs were working properly,\u201d said Gann.\u00a0 \u201cWe got good service out of our existing Extreme switches, but they were limited in their speed and bandwidth because they were older.\u00a0 We needed to prepare to increase our bandwidth.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Walker County BoE ultimately chose Extreme Networks&#8217; solution due to their technology and exceptional service and support that Gann had always received. WCBoE\u2019s solution consisted of a new\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/cloud.kapostcontent.net\/pub\/cf17ce1d-1555-457a-8802-702000d117c6\/extended-edge-switching-solution-brief?kui=f6zjyff8ojBubPKiMOzFrw\">Extreme Extended Edge switching solution<\/a>, including V400 edge switches that were tied into X590 and X465 aggregation switches.\u00a0 In addition, new Extreme Wi-Fi access points both indoors and outdoors providing coverage to support students in parking lots to increase connectivity options for students. On top of the new WiFi network, Walker County made the switch from a legacy Wi-Fi controller to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.extremenetworks.com\/extremecloud-iq\/\">ExtremeCloud IQ<\/a>. With the help from ExtremeCloud IQ, Gann\u2019s team, will have full visibility in the network as well as have the ability to block access for specific devices, and more.<\/p>\n<p>As a result of Walker County BoE\u2019s network infrastructure makeover, the school district has been an immense amount of improvement in its network and its ability to supports its net digital learning programs. ExtremeCloud IQ has made a huge impact and has saved everyone time with its monitoring and management capabilities. Gann\u2019s team is able to dedicate their time to helping students and staff with their devices and managing learning software systems. In addition to the implementation itself, <a href=\"https:\/\/synergetics.com\/\">Synergetics<\/a> was helpful in offering services that would be eligible for <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.extremenetworks.com\/e-rate-resource-center\/\">E-Rate<\/a><\/span><\/span>\u00a0programs. In the end, in terms of Walker County\u2019s mission, they were able to deliver an improved user experience with the ability to more effectively manage those experiences.<\/p>\n<p>Now that Walker County Board of Education is functioning efficiently under its new learning environment thanks to its new <a href=\"https:\/\/www.extremenetworks.com\/products\/\">Extreme Networks technology<\/a>, Gann says he is not done working. Gann has plans to assess the environment and determine how they can continue to deliver and give students and teachers an even better experience. Next steps for Gann include replacing old Chromebooks and adding 2,000 new ones. As teachers began to work more with 3D printing, virtual augmented reality, and more digital teaching tools, he is confident the infrastructure in place will be able to take on any new innovative technologies to come.<\/p>\n<p>For more information please take a look <a href=\"https:\/\/www.extremenetworks.com\/resources\/case-study\/walker-county-schools-switches-to-digital-learning\/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Walker County Board of Education\u2019s case study.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https:\/\/www.extremenetworks.com\/extreme-networks-blog\/walker-county-board-of-education-conquers-covid-19-challenges-with-the-help-of-extremecloud-iq\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Walker County Board of Education Conquers COVID-19 Challenges with the help of ExtremeCloud IQ<\/a> appeared first on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.extremenetworks.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Extreme Networks<\/a>.<\/p>"

evolved into a land governed by data and the control of it, and every day there is a new clich\u00e9 published somewhere likening it to something we can relate to, attempting to enlighten us on a fact that everyone already knows \u2013 we are a data-driven society.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>With <a href=\"https:\/\/www.extremenetworks.com\/extremecloud-iq\/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ExtremeCloud IQ<\/a>, the only concept you need to know is that your data is <em>sovereign<\/em>.<span>\u00a0 <\/span><span>\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.extremenetworks.com\/cloud-technology\/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Cloud technologies<\/a> have helped drive the data-dependent revolution.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>VPN\u2019s are a thing of the past, and access to data is now possible from every type of device, whether desktop PC, a watch, or the very automobile you drive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>The flexibility of cloud-hosting data comes with increased risks associated with data control \u2013 not only your control, but loss of it, and the control of others who have access to your data due to the cloud relationship.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>With ExtremeCloud IQ we spell out our data controls very clearly.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>Within data protection and privacy circles, particularly those that concern themselves with GDPR (the European General Data Protection Regulations), you often hear about concepts such as \u201ccontroller\u201d and \u201cprocessor\u201d in terms of the roles customers and cloud providers play in data privacy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>What are these roles?<span>\u00a0 <\/span>Within GDPR Article 4.7, a controller is defined as \u201c<\/span><span>\u2026 the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data\u2026 .\u201c Accordingly, a processor is defined in the same section as \u201c\u2026 a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>In simple terms, a controller is someone who owns data, and a processor is someone who does things with the data on behalf of the controller and only performs those operations that are mutually agreed upon.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>For instance, you may own your car (a controller), and you may authorize your mechanic to change your oil (a processor), but just because the mechanic is in possession of your car for an hour doesn\u2019t mean he can take it to the dragstrip for a quick run.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>The same concepts apply to data processing rules.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Extreme is a controller for certain administrative information you provide us.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>We may obtain your email address, name, and contact information through our normal course of business.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>We\u2019ll then store that in a CRM like salesforce.com so that we can contact you and record transaction information.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>Salesforce.com is a processor of Extreme\u2019s data, and they can only store it for us in their software.<span>\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>However, in the case of ExtremeCloud IQ, the customer is the controller of all of the network data that goes into the cloud, and we are the processor.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>Every bit, byte, IP address, and statistic that is generated from your switches, routers, and access points are your data and controlled by you.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>ExtremeCloud IQ on the other hand is the processor, creating useful information with the data you provided, and we are only allowed to do with that data what is defined in our processing agreements and terms of service.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>With all cloud solutions, as the customer entrusting your data to a processor, you must be certain of the rights of both yourself and the processor.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>For instance:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><span><span><\/span><\/span><\/span><span>Does the processor use sub-processors?<span>\u00a0 <\/span>Who else sees your data?<span>\u00a0 <\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li><span><span><span><\/span><\/span><\/span><span>Where is my data processing performed?<span>\u00a0 <\/span>Is it done in another country?<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span><span><span><\/span><\/span><\/span><span>Is data stored in other jurisdictions?<span>\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span>Not all clouds are built the same.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>The processor you entrust your data to may do all of the processing in a different country, thus, replicating and storing all or portions of your data in another country.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>This is where data sovereignty comes into play.<span>\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Knowing where your data is stored is a vitally important part of cloud data storage and processing and is key to the concept of data sovereignty.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>Data sovereignty is a concept designed to ensure that your data is kept in a country or a geo-political boundary governed by similar laws and rules and not outside of your legal control.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>For instance, a customer in Germany needs to know if their data is stored in the United States, and would prefer it be stored in Germany, or another country with similar legal protections of data.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>The architecture of ExtremeCloud IQ lends itself to data sovereignty without much effort.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>We keep your data where you want it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>As mentioned in previous blog posts, ExtremeCloud IQ leverages two different kinds of data centers.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>We have Global Data Centers (GDC) which handle device redirection, authentication, and licensing, and we also have Regional Data Centers (RDC) which is where your logical instance resides, and your data is stored.<span>\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>GDCs exist in the US and the EU.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>To protect the personal data that consists of your primary account email and other basic demographic data, all EU and other accounts are stored via the European (Ireland) GDC.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>When you log into ExtremeCloud IQ from Europe, using geographic load balancing, access to your virtual instance (VIQ) is granted from a system within the EU.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>In the US the reverse occurs, and US accounts are authenticated using systems in Virginia.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>The RDCs are placed in various regions for speed of access and data regionalization.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>A customer in Germany will be placed on the RDC in Frankfurt and will authenticate via the Ireland data center, keeping all data within the jurisdiction of the EEA (European Economic Area) and\/or Germany itself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Why is this important?<span>\u00a0 <\/span>By isolating your data in a specific country, you are protected and inherit the rights of that country\u2019s data protection laws.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>For EU customers and customers around the world, this can be important to satisfying a myriad of new and upcoming data privacy concerns.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Further, ExtremeCloud IQ will be ISO 27701 certified in a few short weeks.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>This certification is strictly related to information privacy management, and we meet or exceed all ISO standards for data protection.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Take pride in knowing that your data is sovereign, it\u2019s protected, and at Extreme, we\u2019ll protect it like the King\/oil\/currency\/ lifeblood of your organization that it is.<span>\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https:\/\/www.extremenetworks.com\/extreme-networks-blog\/god-save-the-queen-your-data\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">God Save (the Queen) Your

It can be tough to not see more people who look like me and who are in similar roles as mine, but it doesn\u2019t discourage me.<\/p>\n<p>I wasn\u2019t discouraged when during my first computer programmer interview, the interviewer told me that \u201cmy people\u201d were not really cut out for R&amp;D work in the computer science field. It fueled me to work harder and prove the people who doubted me wrong. Despite any skeptics I have faced, I\u2019ve gone on to work on many innovative projects for different companies and even have one of my software patent applications supported by the Intel Corporation.<\/p>\n<p>As I honor my ancestors, I reflect on the challenges Black people in the US and around the world face on a daily basis. Black History Month is a time to celebrate the accomplishments of my brothers and sisters, as well as the hardships they have faced. Looking back on times when I felt judged in the workplace, I hope that we can create a world where those situations are an anomaly and no longer considered a normal part of the black experience.<\/p>\n<p><strong>My Experience <span>\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>While working on a project for my previous company, I traveled to a university for a summit meeting.<span>\u00a0\u00a0<\/span>The event was for a US DOT sponsored consortium of automobile manufacturers (VII-C) working on a proof of concept project to test vehicle communications infrastructure. We were essentially testing a car\u2019s ability to communicate with other cars and roadside networking equipment mounted on street posts.<\/p>\n<p>My company was responsible for the base Linux OS running on the devices in the cars. It was my job to integrate device drivers and application packages into the base Linux operating system supporting a touch screen interface.<span>\u00a0 <\/span><\/p>\n<p>When I arrived at the university, I found the conference room where we were to be meeting. When I entered, some people assumed I was in the wrong room, so they redirected me to the security office &#8211; the only other place I had seen Black people in the building.<span>\u00a0 <\/span><\/p>\n<p>Having grown up in Canada, I don\u2019t have a regional accent and I have an English man\u2019s name, so it\u2019s possible that some in the room were surprised to see that the person they had been sending their driver updates and packages to was me &#8211; the Black man they saw in front of them.<\/p>\n<p>We had been meeting by conference call for many months before this face-to-face meeting. For me, it was an interesting exercise to match faces to the voices I had listened to for so long without meeting them in person or seeing them on a video call. It seems I made assumptions about them and they had made assumptions about me. There wasn\u2019t any overtly hostile reaction, but just a clear assumption that someone with my face shouldn\u2019t be doing what I was doing.<\/p>\n<p>I don\u2019t remember exactly how I felt at the time because it was so long ago, but the experience has stuck with me. When I face obstacles like that, it just makes me even more determined to get the job done at the time and I lick my wounds later.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What I Learned<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>What I\u2019ve learned from this experience is to push past the initial resistance whether it\u2019s a miscommunication, erroneous assumption, or outright prejudice and get on with the task at hand.<span>\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>As a matter of fact, I didn\u2019t really want to share this story with the world, but this experience has happened often enough in the past and the present that I felt the need to share an example of how awareness or perceptions can shape actions in a negative way.<\/p>\n<p>I think it is really important for all of us to periodically review our perceptions or judgments and the actions we take as a result. They can affect each person differently and have long-term consequences personally and professionally. We all want a chance to live our best lives, so why not help remove the obstacles we might be placed in someone else\u2019s way?<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m honored to be apart of the diversity and inclusion discussions here at Extreme through my post on Black and African American employee resource group Black@Extreme (BEX).

whether you\u2019re a player on the field, a coach on the sideline, or fan in the stands.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>As the most unique NFL season comes to an end, let\u2019s look back at the latest innovations that help teams and their fans safely enjoy the game, and accelerate digital transformation for many years to come.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Handheld Electronic Whistle \u2013 a New Approach to Coaching<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">While coaches don\u2019t partake in as much physical contact as players, it is still equally important that they are equipped with the latest technology to safely instruct with ease.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>Handheld Electronic Whistles replace the traditional breath-powered model and is said to be <a href=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/nfl\/story\/_\/id\/29801368\/what-expect-nfl-officiating-2020-coronavirus-protocols-electronic-whistles-inexperience\">one of the most significant equipment changes this year<\/a>.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>While the Electronic Whistle created by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fox40world.com\/electronic-whistle\">Fox40<\/a> was not originally designed for sports teams, since the outbreak coaches are utilizing the devices during practice as a safety precaution to minimize the spread of the virus.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>The handheld whistle is larger in size compared to the traditional whistle yet designed to still fit it in the palm of a hand.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>Staff can activate the whistle through the touch of the thumb button, which offers a hygienic solution for multiple operators, allowing the user to give verbal, clear, and loud commands.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>Currently, Fox40 is working on a new and improved model that is water-resistant and operates on batteries, so teams can leverage the device for extended periods of time in all weather conditions.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u2018New Normal\u2019 IoT Devices \u2013 Contract Tracing and Keeping Teams Safe <\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">In the unfortunate event that a player tests positive for COVID-19, it is regulation that the League provides contact tracing information to eliminate further spread.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>To monitor social distancing while keeping tabs on player whereabouts, <a href=\"https:\/\/kinexon.com\/manufacturing\">SafeZone tags by Kinexon<\/a> are part of the new protocol for all members of the NFL team environment.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>Kinexon, a German-based company, works alongside sports teams on performance tracking but quickly adapted their approach once the pandemic took over.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>Instead of tracking people and other assets, SafeZone is used to retrieve information on the location and distance between teammates.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>The ultra-lightweight wearable tech not only warns users if they are too close in proximity to one another, but also provides useful information on the duration of each contact, enabling quick access to trace and evaluate possible chains of infection.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>As a part of the new policies outlined by the League &#8211; players, coaches, and staff wear the tags during team activities, practice, and travel.<span>\u00a0 <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Familiar technology, like facial recognition, is also doing its part to keep up with \u2018new normal\u2019 protocols on game day.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>With the capability to match a human face from a digital image against a database of faces, facial recognition has become a popular technology for keeping assets secure.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>Now, facial recognition is being used by teams to prevent spreading germs.<span>\u00a0 <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/nfl\/story\/_\/id\/29737178\/nfl-teams-combating-coronavirus-high-tech-low-tech-ways\">The Houston Texas installed facial recognition<\/a> systems that automatically open doors for \u201cTier1\u201d and \u201cTier2 members\u201d (players, coaches, and support staff).<span>\u00a0 <\/span>Essentially, by recognizing key players and staff, individuals can access the stadium without having to worry about touching doorknobs or other entryway touchpoints.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Contactless Payments \u2013 Once a Commodity, Now a Necessity<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Much like facial recognition, mobile ticketing is not new to the world of digital innovations but has become imperative for stadiums moving forward.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>The pandemic has accelerated technology investments for teams, their stadiums, and their fans.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>But with many teams understandably choosing not to host guest in-stadium this season, a number of fanbases haven\u2019t experienced these technology investments firsthand.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>Luckily, twelve NFL stadiums were able to host fans in-stadium this year. At the Jacksonville Jaguars\u2019 season opener, 14,100 fans got a first look into what the \u2018new normal\u2019 of game day entails.<span>\u00a0 <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/frontofficesports.com\/pandemic-pushing-contactless-technology-forward\/\">\u201cWith TIAA Bank Field at 25% capacity, fans were not only socially distanced and required to wear masks as they moved around, but they also encountered another by-product of the pandemic \u2013 a 100% contactless and paperless payment and ticketing sporting event.\u201d <\/a><span>\u00a0<\/span>Jason Thomas, the CEO of cashless payment company Tappit, notes that organizations who once considered moving to cashless are now making the shift.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>The Jaguar\u2019s worked alongside Tappit to create \u2018Jags Pay\u2019 &#8211; a mobile payment system allowing fans to make purchases through their mobile devices.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Other mobile platforms like <a href=\"https:\/\/satisfilabs.com\/about\/\">Satisfi<\/a>, also provide fans with relevant game day information such as parking information and guest services.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>While the application was once a nice amenity to have on your mobile device, it has become a necessary tool to enter the game and purchase items once in the stadium.<span>\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>3G Wireless Cameras and Replay System \u2013 A Clear View for Spectators Everywhere<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">As for the fans watching from the comfort and safety of their own homes, they can experience game day in a new, yet still exciting way.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>Playoff coverage featured <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sportsvideo.org\/2021\/01\/08\/nfl-playoffs-2021-fox-sports-boosts-super-mos-pyloncams-and-brings-back-megalodon-for-postseason\/\">3G wireless cameras known as PylonCam\u2019s<\/a> that covered the entire end zone allowing for more ground-level angles and ensuring spectators don\u2019t miss a moment.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>EVS Replay System was also leveraged as an \u201cextra motion\u201d replay system.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>Using artificial intelligence, the replay system creates additional frames in a 60-fps replay and enables 180 frames per second, so plays can be played back in super-slow-motion.<span>\u00a0 <\/span><span>\u00a0<\/span>Both the cameras and the replay system are typically not used until a Super Bowl, but with most fans at home Fox Sports was able to leverage the equipment early on this season.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sports Gambling \u2013 Fun for All Fans<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Just like the cameras and replay system, sports teams were extra creative this year in how to best engage fans watching from their living rooms.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>Legal Sports betting has allowed the sports industry to continue generating revenue that might have been lost with smaller in-stadium capacity.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>In response applications like Adrenaline, a sports betting technology service provider and creators of <a href=\"https:\/\/sbcamericas.com\/2021\/01\/21\/adrenaline-teams-with-nfl-icons-to-develop-football-genius-play-by-play-betting\/\">Football Genius<\/a> has improved their betting platform to allow for play-by-play betting in the United States.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>The original Football Genius was only used by coaches to give information on opponents based on data including game situation, player personnel, and tendencies of other coaches.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>Now Football Genius offers in-play betting, allowing fans to not only make bets during a game, but on each play.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>Super Bowl LV will mark the first time in history that fans can bet and weigh in on what they think will happen during every snap.<span>\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">The pandemic has not only promoted technology advancements, but now the sports and entertainment industry must rise to the challenge and design a game day around the \u2018new normal\u2019.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>While it is still uncertain when NFL stadiums will be able to have a packed crowd again, the technology solutions leveraged this past season allowed for the beloved game of football to play on.<span>\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">To read more about the latest in Sports and Public Venues, and to explore how cloud-driven network solutions meet the industry\u2019s \u2018new normal\u2019, check out the resources below:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><span><span><\/span><\/span><\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.extremenetworks.com\/extreme-networks-blog\/future-of-live-sports-panel-how-accelerated-digital-transformation-is-changing-the-game\/\">Future of Live Sports Panel: How Accelerated Digital Transformation is Changing the Game<\/a><\/li>\n<li><span><span><span><\/span><\/span><\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.extremenetworks.com\/extreme-networks-blog\/green-bay-packers-building-and-maintaining-wi-fi-in-an-nfl-stadium\/\">Green Bay Packers: Building and Maintaining Wi-Fi in an NFL Stadium<\/a><\/li>\n<li><span><span><span><\/span><\/span><\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.extremenetworks.com\/resources\/solution-brief\/network-enabled-contactless-payments-in-sports-venues\/\">Network-Enabled Contactless Payments in Sports Venues<\/a><\/li>\n<li><span><span><span><span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.extremenetworks.com\/resources\/video\/why-extreme-for-sports-public-venues\/\">Why Extreme for Sports &amp;

Nearly 40% of those surveyed stated accelerated adoption, and more than 35% noted no slow down of zero trust initiatives. The top impediment to adoption \u2013 reported by 47% of respondents \u2013 is the lack of appropriately skilled professionals. This is where the right partner comes in, as the pandemic provided the opportunity to highlight <a href=\"https:\/\/www.extremenetworks.com\/extreme-networks-blog\/ny-hospital-uses-micro-segmentation-to-eliminate-security-threats\/\">perfect use cases<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>During a December virtual event, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.defense.gov\/Explore\/News\/Article\/Article\/2431541\/covid-related-telework-accelerates-disas-zero-trust-adoption\/\">Vice Adm. Nancy A. Norton explained<\/a>, &#8220;All resources must be consistently accessed in a secure manner using multiple attributes to build confidence levels for appropriate access to resources.\u201d<span>\u00a0<\/span>Zero trust is how that\u2019s accomplished in the network \u2013 underscoring the importance with today\u2019s highly distributed workforces and increased attack surfaces. Per Norton, \u201cnever trust, but always verify\u201d will be central to DoD network security policy.<\/p>\n<p>Extreme Network is in a unique position to offer expertise on the transition to a zero trust security model and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.extremenetworks.com\/extreme-networks-blog\/best-practices-for-zero-trust\/\">putting best practice in action<\/a>. For example, Interfaith Medical Center in Brooklyn, NY, and its 1,500 team members needed network assistance to support more than 200,000 outpatient clinic visits; 50,000 emergency visits; and over 10,000 discharges annually.\u00a0<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\u201cUnderstanding the devices on the network and mapping traffic flow are the basis for policies and permissions&#8230; If a particular communication is not explicitly required for that device to function, it\u2019s going to be blocked by default.\u201d &#8212;\u00a0Interfaith VP for Information Security Christopher Frenz<\/em><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>An Extreme Networks appliance assisted auditing almost 5,000 devices on the network and took a deeper dive into how these devices communicate with data storage, applications, and each other. As Frenz explained, zero trust is enabling optimal communications among resources, applications, and necessary devices.\u00a0\u201cAnything that could get into our network and cause downtime or a delay can have an impact on patient care,\u201d he said pointedly. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.extremenetworks.com\/extreme-networks-blog\/the-infinitely-distributed-enterprise-digital-human-pendulum-swing-and-other-predictions-for-2021\/\">2021 introduces<\/a> the prospect of an open world and the semblance of normalcy.

Or that a Black man in the 1800s patented the telephone transmitter that would pave the way for modern telephones? Did you know that the inventor of Industry Standard Architecture also helped develop the first color PC monitor and first gigahertz chip? What about the first team from Bell Laboratories to introduce digital cellular technology in the United States was led by a Black engineer?

Katherine was one of the first African American women to work as a NASA scientist. She used her skills in math and orbital mechanics to analyze flight paths of spacecrafts, including many of the first US flights. Some of these flights included Apollo, the first mission to Mars, Project Mercury, and later in her career the Freedom 7 which was the flight that sent Alan B. Shepard Jr. to space making him the first American to visit outer space.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nasa.gov\/content\/katherine-johnson-biography\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Learn more about Katherine<\/a>.\u00a0<\/p>\n<h2><span><span>2.\u00a0<span><\/span><\/span><\/span>Granville Wood<\/h2>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><img height=\"105\" src=\"https:\/\/kapost-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\/kapost\/55ba7c9e07003d9aab000394\/studio\/content\/601b1e0eb0188c00f3ab235c\/html_bodies\/1612463336-8aca2105-30bb-4c82-8c0c-73127e582367\/36793-BHM-Inventors-Blog_HEADSHOTS-02.png\" style=\"float: left;\" width=\"105\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Granville Wood grew up in Ohio and started working in his teens as a railroad engineer in steel shops and on the railroad tracks. Wood patented his invention of the telephone transmitter \u2013 which was later purchased by Alexander Bell. This telegraph invention paved the way for more modern telephones to later be produced. His invention also decreased train accidents since communications increased and were faster.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.biography.com\/inventor\/granville-t-woods\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Learn more about Granville<\/a>.\u00a0<\/p>\n<h2><span><span>3.\u00a0<span><\/span><\/span><\/span>Mark E.

Dean was born in Tennessee and grew up loving to construct things alongside his father. He went to the University of Tennessee for engineering and graduated at the top of his class. After college, Dean secured a job at IBM where he became a prominent name in the company. Dean invented the Industry Standard Architecture that allowed disk drives, printers, and monitors to be plugged directly into computers. Following that invention, he also worked on major projects such as developing the first color PC monitor and gigahertz chip. Dean was the first African American to become an IBM fellow (in 1996).<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.biography.com\/inventor\/mark-dean\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Learn more about Mark<\/a>.\u00a0<\/p>\n<h2><span><span>4.\u00a0<span><\/span><\/span><\/span>Jesse Russell<\/h2>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><img height=\"106\" src=\"https:\/\/kapost-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\/kapost\/55ba7c9e07003d9aab000394\/studio\/content\/601b1e0eb0188c00f3ab235c\/html_bodies\/1612463393-de6acefd-06f9-4cac-a278-a42577319a01\/36793-BHM-Inventors-Blog_HEADSHOTS-04.png\" style=\"float: left;\" width=\"105\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Jesse Russell was a pioneer in the field of cellular and wireless communications.

She lived in a high-crime neighborhood, and both she and her husband worked long and irregular hours. For that reason, Marie developed a home security system (US patent 3,482,037), the first closed-circuit television system, in 1966 with the help of her husband Albert. Her invention paved the way for modern security systems that are used not only in homes but also in banks, offices, stores, and apartment complexes.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/timeline.com\/marie-van-brittan-brown-b63b72c415f0\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Learn more about Marie<\/a>.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>These five inventors were pioneers of their time and made a lasting impact on technology.

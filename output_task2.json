It is a one-way function, and since there is no relation between both the text being interpreted and the summary value, it is difficult to derive the actual data from the summary value received. The same meaning for the same data is produced in the hash process, but the value provided by the hash function often varies when there is a minor shift. Digest functions are typically used in fields such as data integrity authentication, password storage,",

Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and related technologies like SD-WAN, SASE, etc., are bringing capability to control the network securely by programming the routing packets as per requirement without changing the network hardware. Such new networking technologies give huge power to network administrators. Enterprises using these technologies are realizing business benefits along with capital expenditure (CapEx) savings to connect global business networks. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\" xml:lang=\"EN\"><span>But leaders still need to understand the exact outcome to shift away from legacy networks that potentially yield central management of networks while saving money.

To address this, enterprise networks need simplification in terms of routing data to exact users with the right policies applied to it and make sure the different set of end-users get data or network services they want in a short period of time. With technologies like SDN and Network Functions Virtualization (NFV), it is now possible to control the network infrastructure by replacing most of the network components and achieving a high level of zero-touch automation and provisioning. Using such technologies, enterprises can also reduce the CapEx and reduce the power consumption required in the network. With new software-based and software-driven technologies in hand, it is also replacing legacy networks that can route traffic based on congestion patterns at some part of the network. You get end-to-end visibility in your network that can help you in managing the network bandwidth and identify the network glitches that also can be fixed remotely. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><b><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 14.0pt;\" xml:lang=\"EN\"><span>Cloud-ready<\/span><\/span><\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\" xml:lang=\"EN\"><span>Most enterprises are adopting cloud as a part of digital initiatives. Legacy networks are not enough to match the agility required by cloud services. The services are configured either within the internal private cloud or subscribed from public cloud. A new model of hybrid, as well as multi-cloud, is also making into enterprise infrastructure to take advantage of benefits offered from different clouds and optimize the cost of business services. It is high time where enterprise CIO will want the network to fit into the cloud equation so that it is possible for cloud applications to run on the network and delivered to end-users with optimal performance. There are various new solutions that have emerged that also give network visibility when enterprises implement hybrid and multi-cloud so that they can manage cloud applications that reside in different clouds with ease. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><b><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 14.0pt;\" xml:lang=\"EN\"><span>Lowering the cost<\/span><\/span><\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\" xml:lang=\"EN\"><span>Legacy network was architected using proprietary hardware equipment to perform designated network functions that required manual configuration to get functional.

Due to pandemic, remote working has become a norm, and we have seen an increase in video streaming in the form of live webinars, video calls, and video demos. Traditionally, Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP) is used for the speedy delivery of video streams over the network. But modern networks require protocols to support low latency streaming. In this case, HTTP-based protocols are being used, for example, Apple HLS (HTTP Live Streaming), Low-Latency HLS, Low-Latency CMAF for DASH (Common Media Application Format for DASH), MPEG-DASH (Moving Picture Expert Group Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP). VPNs are commonly used by enterprises to connect to internal networks, and it is recommended to use secure communication. But modern networks are developed to get over VPNs with the proper use of technologies like SD-WAN. It is important to ensure the support for secure video streaming using such new technologies.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>",

However, with challenge comes opportunity, significant opportunity to change past behaviors. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\" xml:lang=\"EN\"><span>Interestingly, the concerns of CFOs are actually accelerating modernization within their organization due to the economics and operational model of the cloud.\u00a0 Evaluating the economic impact of cloud strategies comes down to three crucial questions. First, what is the return on investment (ROI) for migrating to the cloud or changing to a different cloud service? Second, what is the total cost of ownership (TCO) for making that migration or change? And third, how does the ROI and TCO of the new cloud solution or provider compare to a traditional on-premises or hybrid one?<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\" xml:lang=\"EN\"><span>The best CFOs understand that with the right outlook on the economics of cloud computing, they can optimize their investments and obtain the greatest value for their organization.

They can help eliminate technical debt, keep infrastructure current, embrace navigational course corrections, and free up capital expenditures to focus on all those other strategic initiatives that couldn\u2019t be funded or executed before. At the end of the day, they need to get more done faster, and often with less. Modern as-a-Service models eliminate lengthy, costly, and difficult-to-scale contracts, giving companies the ability to scale and pay as they go, forever changing the landscape of what's possible with cloud. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\" xml:lang=\"EN\"><span>Many CFOs want to purchase services the same way they sell them \u2013 on-demand with a low commitment to start and the ability to grow as you go.\u00a0 The usership economy is gaining ground in all traditional IT infrastructure areas, and the benefits are clear: Research shows that many CIOs feel consumption-based models significantly accelerate digital transformation due to the transparency and agility to repurpose capital to address business demand. This is because the flexibility in pricing allows them to scale as their needs do.

As your needs increase, it should proactively scale up the business\u2019s infrastructure and capacity, eliminating the risk of re-buys if a CAPEX purchase is undersized. Start small and grow your environment to meet demands with predictable unit costs in a pay-as-you-go model.

Underpinned by a flexible architecture, the migration to the right solution should be the only migration you ever need to perform.\u00a0 Furthermore, a truly flexible service offering must be one that can both be moved or migrated from environment to environment, but also one that can be repurposed to meet other application needs very quickly, as urgent business needs arise.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><b><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\" xml:lang=\"EN\"><span>Strong AI-driven capabilities: <\/span><\/span><\/b><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\" xml:lang=\"EN\"><span>The right solution will have strong AI-driven tools at its core.

If they need more from a given solution, they should be able to choose to increase their commitment and get even better discounts for the remainder of the agreement. The solution should also maintain ownership of all assets throughout the life of the service, which aligns costs to <i>usage<\/i> and not <i>assets<\/i> underpinning the service, creating a real OPEX model.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><b><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\" xml:lang=\"EN\"><span>Net Present Value Improvements:<\/span><\/span><\/b><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\" xml:lang=\"EN\"><span> Balancing future investment with current expenses is a big challenge for many CFOs.

With just about every major communications supplier in the hunt for the highly coveted C-band spectrum, it's not surprising that the final bids <a href=\"https:\/\/www.networkcomputing.com\/wireless-infrastructure\/mid-band-spectrum-usa-first-and-last\" target=\"_blank\">topped analyst expectations by almost triple the initial estimates<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>While it will be months before we know who the winners are, the impact and importance of the C-Band auction for the future of 5G cannot be overstated.<\/p>\n<p><b><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height: 107%;\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">Striking a balance: C-band spectrum and the benefits of an evolving 5G infrastructure <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<p>To date, the overwhelming majority of 5G offerings reside in either the low- or high-band, also referred to as millimeter wave (mmWave), part of the spectrum. But if the hallmarks of network performance attributes are speed, capacity, and coverage, few, if any, 5G providers have been able to strike a balance between all three. The result? Consumers and early adopters have faced something of a Hobson's choice (aka \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d). On the one hand, you have the speed and capacity of high-band mmWave (24GHz, 27GHz) but with limited coverage. And on the other hand, you have the wider coverage but significantly lower speeds and capacity associated with low-band spectrum (600MHz, 800MHz).<\/p>\n<p>5G's success, however, depends on achieving equilibrium between all three attributes rather than sacrificing one or two at the expense of another. It is this all-important balance that the C-band spectrum provides. Operating at frequencies between the low- and high-bands, C-band spectrum (3.7GHz to 3.98GHz) bridges the divide between speed, coverage, and capacity, offering transmission rates considerably higher than its low-band 5G and 4G siblings while simultaneously providing broad geographic coverage.<\/p>\n<p><b><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height: 107%;\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">The future imagined vs. the future within reach<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<p>C-band spectrum upends the 5G infrastructure challenge typically associated with high-band, mmWave network deployment. In contrast to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fiercewireless.com\/operators\/where-s-beef-2020-capex-major-u-s-wireless-carriers\" target=\"_blank\">the CapEx intensive process of creating a network dense enough to maintain mmWave signal continuity<\/a>, C-band allows providers to reuse and repurpose their existing cellular infrastructure, including towers, small cells, radios, backhaul, and, most importantly, the power needed to achieve significant gains without having to build from scratch.<\/p>\n<p>Though these changes won't be instantaneous, C-band spectrum can significantly lower the costs associated with 5G deployment and accelerate the timeline for establishing a more extensive and reliable 5G network capable of producing tangible benefits. As the three use cases below illustrate, the advent of C-band means the connected future of 5G is closer than ever before.<\/p>\n<p><b><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height: 107%;\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">Business applications of 5G: Digital transformation and the C-band value prop<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<p>Over the past year, the rapid pace of digital transformation and the unprecedented shift to remote work has placed seamless connectivity and reliable, on-demand access to data at the forefront of business operations. Video conferencing, wireless communication platforms, virtual networks, and collaborative digital workspaces all require the speed, capacity, and reliability to support more devices running ever-evolving suites of data-centric business applications.<\/p>\n<p>With 280 MHz of C-Band slated to come online by 2023, the balanced yet significant benefits of mid-band 5G will accommodate new hybrid models of work that seek to maintain productivity, flexibility, and efficiency by blending the traditional experience of working inside the office with working from home.<\/p>\n<p>Further, as businesses look to a future where we will all be in offices together again, there are clear benefits to transitioning from Wi-Fi to 5G connectivity \u2013 ranging from security to uptime to greater speeds. And while this won\u2019t happen overnight, the C-band auction opens the door to begin the transition, and it\u2019s expected that 5G connectivity will be on many enterprises\u2019 budget sheets for the 2023 fiscal year and beyond.<\/p>\n<p><b><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height: 107%;\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">Smart cities: Paving the digital pathway<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<p>Discussions around smart cities typically conjure images of connectivity that stretch well beyond the home and office.

By increasing data transfer speeds from 100Mbps to 500Mbps, C-band spectrum will play a crucial role in enhancing throughput and productivity while greatly expanding the bandwidth and capacity necessary to accommodate the growing number of IoT devices at the heart of the smart factory.<\/p>\n<p><b><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height: 107%;\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">Making the 5G revolution a reality <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<p>From its inception, 5G has been touted as nothing short of revolutionary.

    "summary": "<p>Cellular networks and corporate LANs have existed as separate entities for decades. However, that may soon change. The shared 3.5GHz CBRS spectrum has created an opportunity where a business can now deploy and manage their own <a href=\"https:\/\/www.networkcomputing.com\/wireless-infrastructure\/why-cbrs-band-opportunity-private-lte-networks\" target=\"_blank\">private LTE or 5G wireless network<\/a>. While this is a major leap forward from a wireless connectivity standpoint, this architectural model still suffers from the fact that 5G networking technologies differ significantly from traditional LAN routing\/switching counterparts. Thus, the two networks must continue to be managed separately. Let\u2019s look at some of the key performance benefits that 5G technologies possess \u2013 and how enterprises may soon be able to take the technological advancements of 5G networking and seamlessly merge them with their existing corporate network.<\/p>\n<p><b><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height: 107%;\">The benefits of 5G over legacy corporate networks<\/span><\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<p>It's no secret that wireless technologies are taking over the enterprise when it comes to endpoint connectivity. Wi-Fi is being relied on heavily to provide network access to end-user laptops, tablets, smartphones, and autonomous IoT sensors. While <a href=\"https:\/\/www.networkcomputing.com\/wireless-infrastructure\/comparing-wi-fi-6e-wi-fi-6\" target=\"_blank\">Wi-Fi has indeed come a long way<\/a> from a connection stability and resiliency standpoint, the technology continues to suffer from outdated traffic management and quality of service (QoS) techniques that were brought over from the world of LAN switching. The shortcoming found within Wi-Fi makes it difficult for IT administrators to be able to guarantee service-level metrics (e.g., max latency\/jitter, minimum throughput) for mission-critical applications.<\/p>\n<p>A lack of service delivery control is one of the main reasons why some IT leaders are beginning to look at private 5G mobile networks as an alternative or supplement to Wi-Fi. 5G uses the concepts of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.networkcomputing.com\/file\/when-cloud-and-sdn-collide\" target=\"_blank\">software-defined networking<\/a> (SDN) and network slicing to streamline the classification of traffic with the ability to deliver predictable wireless performance for prioritized packet flows. SDN is useful in this situation as it acts as a centralized source of policy enforcement truth for the entire wireless network. The centralized control plane is where network performance policy is created. This policy is then automatically pushed to the entirety of the 5G network. This is contrasted to making policy configuration changes on a hop-by-hop basis, as is the case with legacy LAN architectures.<\/p>\n<p>Next, network slicing technologies within 5G create a virtual end-to-end network for a well-defined group of traffic flows.\u00a0 A \"slice\" is a way of multiplexing a transport medium \u2013 which in this case -- is 5G. Comparing network slicing to traditional QoS that already exists on the corporate LAN, WAN, and WLAN, slicing is superior in two specific ways. First, the types of traffic flows that are placed into virtual network slice groups can be configured to be highly granular. For example, while traffic for an individual application can be placed into a network slice group, that same traffic can be further segmented to only allow network application flows from specific source and\/or destination devices. This level of granularity is difficult, if not impossible, to achieve and maintain using traditional QoS methods.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, because network slicing creates a multiplexed virtual network from end-to-end and since 5G wireless allows for complete infrastructure control for traffic transmission scheduling on connected devices, a proper service level agreement (SLA) policy can be imposed across the network slice to guarantee throughput and latency performance numbers. This is opposed to QoS that uses interface buffers to assist with the prioritization of traffic on a hop-by-hop basis. Simply put, network slicing can enforce service-level metrics while legacy QoS only makes a best-effort attempt.<\/p>\n<p><b><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt;\"><span style=\"line-height: 107%;\">Merging the benefits of 5G into the corporate LAN, WAN, and WLAN<\/span><\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<p>The performance and SLA benefits of 5G are clear. That\u2019s precisely why we\u2019re seeing enterprise IT departments looking into the possible integration of private 5G networks with their existing corporate network.<\/p>\n<p>But while <a href=\"https:\/\/www.networkcomputing.com\/wireless-infrastructure\/taking-advantage-cbrs-private-lte-networks\" target=\"_blank\">private 5G networks in the enterprise may solve one problem<\/a>, it creates another. In this case, IT administrators would not only be responsible for maintaining network performance and security policy across the new private 5G network \u2013 but also the management of separate policy within their existing corporate network. This situation creates duplicated processes and greatly increases the chance for configuration error.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s this problem that Celona, a Silicon Valley startup comprised of former HPE Aruba executives and engineers, hopes to resolve. While Celona will happily help a business design and deploy a private LTE or 5G wireless network, the company is looking at the bigger picture from an enterprise architecture standpoint. Celona\u2019s vision is to overhaul existing approaches to private 5G network integrations with the SDN and performance innovations necessary for its adoption within enterprise environments.<\/p>\n<p>Celona\u2019s platform uses a combination of network overlay software and cloud computing. What you get is a single corporate network comprised of LAN, WAN \u2013 and private 5G wireless networks that are seamlessly enabled with common application and device group level policies. The Celona platform comes with complete control on predictable wireless performance for individual enterprise applications with its network slicing technology.<\/p>\n<p>It's an interesting take on 5G, SDN, and the quest to seamlessly merge \u2013 rather than bolt-on \u2013 new network technologies with old.<\/p>",

Starting with onboarding employees \u2013 and the added fun of remote working \u2013 it quickly becomes apparent that a newly merged organization faces a messy stew of mismatched platform architectures and endpoint operating systems.

Putting in place a few best practices can save countless hours of staff time and provide the newly merged workforce with a productive work environment.

IT needs a thorough inventory of platforms, critical applications, and devices the merged entities are using. It likely will include a mix of disparate endpoint hardware from different vendors, each of which has its own flavor of OS (including Windows 7, Windows 10, Windows Embedded, multiple Linux distributions, or MacOS).<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"background: white;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">With more devices in play in the remote environment, IT also needs to obtain a clear assessment of employees' expectations. No doubt, those working from home will prefer to make as few changes as possible in terms of the devices they use. They may even prefer to use a personal (non-business asset) device. Having knowledge of what applications and secure access need to be delivered on those devices is essential to a smoothly functioning merger.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"background: white;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"><b><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">Adopt a user mindset: <\/span><\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">The most powerful integration will come from viewing all changes through the lens of the employee\/user. At the endpoint, employees from Company A or Company B will expect easy, quick access to all the familiar tools they need to be productive.

Critical to this is making sure the merged organization is using the very latest virtualization client software from Citrix, Microsoft, or VMware, as well as the latest unified communications tools like Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Cisco WebEx, or GoToMeeting.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"background: white;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">An OS that supports this modernization will be able to provide easy, secure access to virtualized applications, desktops, and cloud workspaces.

With the recent surge in year-over-year M&amp;A activity, however, it is not unusual for an organization to end up with three, four, or even more platforms focused on managing user endpoint devices from multiple hardware and software providers. The result is a cumbersome and costly mix of disparate endpoint hardware and operating systems, as well as multiple, isolated endpoint management platforms that cannot be integrated.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"background: white;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">Therefore, companies deploying a platform-independent vehicle for unifying endpoint management and control will be far ahead of the game when having to integrate applications and devices from another entity. Rapid integration of different endpoint devices and operating systems can be possible if the endpoint solution is able to support the merged organization\u2019s ecosystem of partner technologies quickly and easily.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"background: white;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"><b><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">Taking the messiness out of mergers<\/span><\/span><\/b><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"background: white;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">Integrating technology from often somewhat disparate entities can occur without extreme disruption.

    "link": "https:\/\/www.networkcomputing.com\/wireless-infrastructure\/mid-band-spectrum-usa-first-and-last",
    "summary": "<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">I have not liked describing 5G as a \u201crace\u201d between nations.\u00a0 Therefore, I run a risk by using the following comparison: \u00a0Among the leading countries in 5G deployment, the USA was the first to define and allocate millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands, and we are the last to allocate mid-band spectrum. The C-band auction (3.7-4.2GHz), <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fiercewireless.com\/regulatory\/c-band-clock-phase-auction-tops-charts-80-9b\" target=\"_blank\">which netted $80.9 billion<\/a>, is the USA\u2019s first foray into exclusive licensing in the mid-band spectrum for commercial wireless. This marked the highest-grossing spectrum auction ever in the U.S.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">This comes two years after the 3.5GHz auctions concluded in South Korea and over 18 months after their first NR commercial launch. What is the significance of this? How do we expect this to impact 5G in the USA?<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">I must first address the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) fans who will challenge my opening lines. I have stated for years as a 5G program manager at Keysight that shared spectrum (between technologies and between commercial entities) is inevitable and essential. I admire the CBRS experiment given small-geography licensing and co-primary use. \u00a0However, it has always felt just like that - an <i>experiment<\/i>. Bands are a maximum of 10MHz, newcomers must take second priority to the US military, license terms are only ten years (only after a fight to get them increased beyond three), and re-farming transition plans for incumbents extend to the better part of a decade. Therefore, I see CBRS as usable in specialized applications (e.g., Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)), more so than for general enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) models of today\u2019s mainstream 5G rollouts. The operative word is \"shared\" or \"co-primary.\" \u00a0Commercial operators dislike shared spectrum. \u00a0Given the state of the art of our mobile wireless systems, they lose control of the customer experience.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">Europe, Korea, Japan, and China all have exclusive mid-band spectrum licensing to provide greenfield territory for 5G deployments.\u00a0 This new spectrum comes at a price. Propagation loss is higher, so cell-sizes are smaller (more base stations (gNodeB (gNB\u2019s)), associated link-budgets are tougher (more complex and expensive gNB\u2019s), and the state of the components and circuits for 3.5-4GHz applications is less mature (more expensive). <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><b><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">Why it matters<\/span><\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">The addition of the new frequency band also means a more challenging regulatory environment; this is especially the case in Europe, given increased electromagnetic energy in many locations that are already at their legal limit. \u00a0However, this mid-band is new to commercial mobile wireless, and thus, the license holders do not have to force 5G to compete with a legacy radio interface in the same band. This simplifies deployment, especially given the other challenges of deploying in this new band.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">While T-Mobile deployed 5G in the low-band using their 600MHz spectrum, the other large operators in the US were constrained to using 3GPP\u2019s version of DSS (Dynamic Spectrum Sharing LTE and New Radio (NR) in the same channel) to establish nation-wide coverage of 5G NR. Indeed, Verizon launched in mid-October this year.\u00a0 I enjoy watching the associated DSS headlines with a mix of:<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">Promotion coming from vendors who have implemented and deployed DSS<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">Positive announcements from operators who have launched 5G as a result<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">Disdain coming from operators who claim not to need it<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">Recent headlines indicating early frustration with a troubling decrease in system performance, given the unavoidable overhead with this technology. <\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">DSS is brilliant because, for now, there are too few 5G user equipment (UE) devices to make efficient use of the greenfield 5G spectrum. But it also means that neither LTE nor NR can make full use of each technologies' specific designs for maximal use of that spectrum.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">Thus, we have the need for exclusive mid-band licenses\u2014especially in the USA. This latest move by the FCC is more than welcome. This also comes at an interesting cost. The mobile industry (auction winners) must also fund the compression of the current satellite use from the entire 500MHz of this band into the upper 200MHz. This is a cost estimated by the FCC at $3-5B with an \"incentive\" of up to $9.7B, if they transition within three years (the <\/span><\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/docs.fcc.gov\/public\/attachments\/FCC-20-22A1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">R&amp;O from the FCC<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\"> from March 2020 is worthwhile, if lengthy, read for the curious).\u00a0 This will further constrain the growing and intriguing satellite business. This is coming not only at a time of significant advancement in satellite and launch technologies but also of 3GPP's embracing of non-terrestrial network technology Rel-17 and beyond. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">I cannot claim to understand the satellite business, so I remain unclear on its impact. But this move will result in a significant upgrade for mobile wireless in the USA. Notwithstanding the challenges of compressing satellite usage (which will include replacing some satellites), deploying lots of small cells (easements, local zoning, backhaul), making massive MIMO work efficiently (expensive and power-hungry gNB\u2019s), and deploying adequate numbers of C-band-capable UE\u2019s, the new spectrum is just what the doctor ordered for us. One of the most interesting parts of any FCC R&amp;O is in the final pages. This is where the commissioners express personal views on the decision. The FCC is more political than technical, and the associated tensions become palpable in reading these statements. At least two commissioners dissented with this 250-page decision.\u00a0 However, the dissent was constrained to implementation and legal specifics. No one disagreed with the need to dedicate more mid-band spectrum to 5G.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">From a selfish perspective, this is a benefit, and for me, it is exciting. The expanded use-models of radio spectrum have impacted a large part of my career since starting fresh out of school in 1985. We remain enthusiastic about the 5G opportunity and look forward to being a key part of making every band from 600MHz to 71GHz work to its utmost for the sake of a society with better communications.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt;\"><i><span style=\"color: black;\">Roger Nichols is 5G Program Manager at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.keysight.com\/us\/en\/home.html\" target=\"_blank\">Keysight Technologies<\/a>.<\/span><\/i><\/p>",

It should not touch the TCP layer...but I'm not up to date with the latest inovations :) <\/p>\n\n<p>Could some specialist give their advice? <\/p>\n\n<p>Thanks<\/p>\n\n<p>Alex<\/p>",

When upgrading from a fairly old to a newer PAN-OS version, multi-step upgrades might be necessary. This ensures the device\u2019s configuration is migrated to the PAN-OS's newer supported features and that nothing \u201cbreaks\u201d during the upgrade process.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Like most vendors, Palo Alto Networks produce a <strong>base image<\/strong> and <strong>maintenance releases. Maintenance releases<\/strong> are small upgrades of the <strong>base image<\/strong> and deal with <strong>bug fixes<\/strong> and sometimes introduce small enhancements.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As a rule of thumb, firewalls should be running the Palo Alto <a href=\"https:\/\/live.paloaltonetworks.com\/t5\/customer-resources\/support-pan-os-software-release-guidance\/ta-p\/258304\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">preferred PAN-OS release<\/a>, and it is generally a good practice to install these releases as they are published.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When upgrading your PAN-OS to the <strong>latest maintenance release<\/strong> of a <strong>newer base release<\/strong>, the firewall <strong>will likely require<\/strong> you to <strong>download the new base release<\/strong> before allowing you to install its <strong>latest maintenance release<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For example, our firewall is currently running version <strong>9.0.3-h3<\/strong>, noted by the \u2018<strong>tick<\/strong>\u2019 on the <strong>Currently Installed<\/strong> column, and our goal is to upgrade to version <strong>9.1.4 (preferred release)<\/strong> as shown below:<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"Palo Alto PAN-OS upgrade path\" src=\"http:\/\/www.firewall.cx\/images\/stories\/palo-alto-firewalls\/firewall-pan-os-upgrade-standalone\/pan-os-upgrade-path.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Palo Alto PAN-OS upgrade path\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When attempting to <strong>download version 9.1.4<\/strong>, a<strong> maintenance release for base 9.1.0<\/strong>, we received an error (see screenshot below) explaining that we need to <strong>download<\/strong> <strong>9.1.0 base image<\/strong> first (no installation required).

With it, admins can <strong>identify issues<\/strong>, <strong>discover non-compliant users<\/strong>, refine their provisioning, and more. <strong>Netflow<\/strong> is a protocol developed by <strong>CISCO<\/strong> that fulfils this purpose, letting interested parties understand <strong>network patterns<\/strong> and <strong>protocol distribution<\/strong>, while supporting more granular data like <strong>IP service type<\/strong> for diagnosis.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Its relatively <strong>low overhead<\/strong> and <strong>trusted history<\/strong> means that <strong>Netflow<\/strong> is still around in some forms a decade after its release. As well as <strong>user and application monitoring<\/strong>, admins utilize <strong>Netflow<\/strong> for <strong>network planning<\/strong>, <strong>application reporting and profiling<\/strong>, <strong>security analysis<\/strong>, and <strong>usage-based reporting and billing<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"cisco netflow router cache\" id=\"cisco netflow router cache\" src=\"http:\/\/www.firewall.cx\/images\/stories\/networking\/netflow\/netflow-basics-components-tools\/cisco-netflow-router-cache.png\" style=\"margin: 7px auto; border: 1px solid #000000; display: block;\" title=\"cisco netflow router cache\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Broadly, a <strong>flow<\/strong> is a <strong>group of packets<\/strong> part of the <strong>same conversation<\/strong> between <strong>two endpoints<\/strong> in a network.

    "summary": "<p>In the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kwtrain.com\/blog\/advanced-ospf-pt3\">previous part of our OSPF series<\/a>, we examined&nbsp;options for manually filtering routes. As we wrap up our look at advanced OSPF topics, we'll discuss default routes, and compare OSPFv2 with OSPFv3.<\/p>\n<h2>Default Routes<\/h2>\n<p>We have seen where OSPF can automatically generate a default route when needed. This occurs with some of our special area types. For example, of you configure a totally stubby area, of course a default route is required and OSPF generates this route automatically from the ABR.<\/p>\n<p>In order to increase flexibility with your designs, default routes injected into a normal area can be originated by any OSPF router. To generate a default route, you use the <strong>default-information originate&nbsp;<\/strong>command.<\/p>\n<p>This command presents two options:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can advertise 0.0.0.0 into the OSPF domain, provided the advertising router already has a default route.<\/li>\n<li>You can advertise 0.0.0.0 regardless of whether the advertising router already has a default route. This second method is accomplished by adding the keyword <strong>always&nbsp;<\/strong>to the <strong>default-information originate<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong><img height=\"168\" src=\"https:\/\/kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net\/kajabi-storefronts-production\/blogs\/3184\/images\/HteYPEtTZaJ8mtQvg9uQ_Z-1.png\" width=\"603\" \/><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Figure 1 - OSPF Topology<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Using our simple topology from Figure 1 once again, let's configure ATL2 to inject a default route into the normal, non-backbone Area 1.<\/p>\n<p><img height=\"153\" src=\"https:\/\/kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net\/kajabi-storefronts-production\/blogs\/3184\/images\/FbChhsqTiu7w8P5dTRPy_Screen_Shot_2019-07-08_at_2.54.09_PM.png\" width=\"603\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Note that in this example, we use the always keyword in order to make sure that ATL2 generates the default route regardless of whether the device already has a default route present in its routing table.<\/p>\n<p>Here is the verification on ORL:<\/p>\n<p><img height=\"824\" src=\"https:\/\/kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net\/kajabi-storefronts-production\/blogs\/3184\/images\/OGNpFbefS4za9K9pGKA5_Screen_Shot_2019-07-08_at_2.55.37_PM.png\" width=\"603\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Comparing OSPFv2 and OSPFv3<\/h2>\n<p>As amazing as OSPFv2 is, it cannot route IPv6 prefixes for us. This is the job of OSPFv3. The great news for you is the fact that you can leverage almost everything you have learned about OSPFv2 when transitioning to the OSPFv3 protocol. There was not a complete redesign of the protocol, and as much functionality and configuration steps were maintained as possible.<\/p>\n<p>As you will learn in this section, OSPFv3 offers the use of address families in the configuration, making this protocol suited for carrying IPv6 prefixes, or even IPv4 prefixes with the appropriate address family.<\/p>\n<p>For the sake of completion, this section demonstrates the &ldquo;standard&rdquo; configuration of OSPFv3, as well as the address family configuration.<\/p>\n<p>It is fun, and important, to distinguish the key similarities and differences between v2 and v3 of the OSPF protocols.&nbsp;Here are the similarities that jump off the page:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>In OSPFv3, a routing process does not need to be explicitly created. Enabling OSPFv3 on an interface will cause a routing process and its associated configuration to be created.<\/li>\n<li>The router ID is still a 32-bit value in OSPFv3 and the process of router ID selection is the same. OSPF automatically prefers a loopback interface over any other kind, and it chooses the highest IP address among all loopback interfaces. If no loopback interfaces are present, the highest IP address in the device is chosen.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Here are some key differences:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>In OSPFv3, each interface must be enabled using commands in interface configuration mode. This feature is different from OSPF version 2, in which interfaces are indirectly enabled using the device configuration mode.<\/li>\n<li>When using a nonbroadcast multiaccess interface in OSPFv3, you must manually configure the device with the list of neighbors. Neighboring devices are identified by their device ID.<\/li>\n<li>In IPv6, you can configure many address prefixes on an interface. In OSPFv3, all address prefixes on an interface are included by default. You cannot select some address prefixes to be imported into OSPFv3; either all address prefixes on an interface are imported, or no address prefixes on an interface are imported.<\/li>\n<li>Unlike OSPF version 2, multiple instances of OSPFv3 can be run on a link.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Traditional OSPFv3 Configuration<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In order to demonstrate (and practice) the OSPFv3 configuration, lets drop such a topology in right alongside the existing IPv4 topology that we have.<\/p>\n<p>Here is the configuration of our backbone area (Area 0) and non-backbone area (Area 1) using the &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; OSPFv3 approach.<\/p>\n<p><img height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net\/kajabi-storefronts-production\/blogs\/3184\/images\/Lw0jVLD3RMSOjg66CTQA_Screen_Shot_2019-07-08_at_2.58.32_PM.png\" width=\"603\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Note how familiar this configuration approach seems, especially if you are a fan of the interface-level approach to configuring OSPFv2. Notice also, we must globally enable the IPv6 unicast routing capability on the device. This is not a default behavior.

For example, you can configure a distribute list approach and filter inbound using it.<\/p>\n<p>In this example, we will once again pick on 192.168.10.0.

The OSPF database proves the NSSA works as advertised at this point. We can see the external prefixes brought in to Area 1 as Type 7 in the database. Let&rsquo;s quickly check over on ATL to see if they appear there as Type 5 LSAs as we would expect.<\/p>\n<p><img height=\"600\" src=\"https:\/\/kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net\/kajabi-storefronts-production\/blogs\/3184\/images\/9tNoVgMRym0pk7gnEpgw_Screen_Shot_2019-07-08_at_2.18.14_PM.png\" width=\"603\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img height=\"531\" src=\"https:\/\/kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net\/kajabi-storefronts-production\/blogs\/3184\/images\/778R3UquSaGOvkLKcxjY_Screen_Shot_2019-07-08_at_2.19.15_PM.png\" width=\"603\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Yes, the output makes sense for our understanding of how the NSSA works.

So, in our network above, we would not have full reachability!

    "summary": "<p>The time has arrived to tackle some of the more advanced (and interesting) features of the Open Shortest Path First routing protocol.

This is an exercise that is not only fun, but it can really cement the knowledge down of how these areas function and why they exist.<\/p>\n<h2>OSPF LSA Types<\/h2>\n<p>Areas are a fundamental concept of OSPF. It is what makes the routing protocol, hierarchical, as we like to say.<\/p>\n<p>There is a core backbone area (Area 0) that connects to normal, non-backbone areas. The backbone might also connect to special area types we will examine in detail in this chapter. This hierarchical nature of the design helps ensure the protocol is very scalable.

The Area Border Router (ABR) is ATL2 with one interface in the backbone and one in the non-backbone area.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Notice also how we get some &ldquo;bonus&rdquo; verification free of charge. As we are configuring the interfaces, we can see OSPF adjacencies forming between the devices. This saves us from needing to verify these &ldquo;manually&rdquo; with the following command:<\/p>\n<p><img height=\"158\" src=\"https:\/\/kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net\/kajabi-storefronts-production\/blogs\/3184\/images\/QXxb5zTdTHm2x98GIeNZ_Screen_Shot_2019-07-08_at_1.50.16_PM.png\" width=\"601\" \/><\/p>\n<p>An interesting verification for us here is to check for the prefix of 1.1.1.0\/24 from the ATL device (as well as the remote link between ATL and ATL2). We check for this on ORL to verify the multi-area configuration of OSPF. Since this is a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; area, all LSAs should be permitted in the area and we should see the prefix appear as an inter-area OSPF route.<\/p>\n<p><img height=\"584\" src=\"https:\/\/kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net\/kajabi-storefronts-production\/blogs\/3184\/images\/4YgkVYCDSxydMInA45O9_Screen_Shot_2019-07-08_at_1.52.57_PM.png\" width=\"602\" \/><\/p>\n<p>While not often required in troubleshooting, we can examine the OSPF database in order to see the different types of LSAs in place.<\/p>\n<p><img height=\"431\" src=\"https:\/\/kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net\/kajabi-storefronts-production\/blogs\/3184\/images\/BGkb7RYGR5iumaGvmoUl_Screen_Shot_2019-07-08_at_1.53.55_PM.png\" width=\"602\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The router link state entries are the Type 1 LSAs. These are the endpoints in our local area of 1. The net link state entries are the Type 2 LSAs. Here we see the router ID of the Designated Router. Finally, the summary net link states are the Type 3 LSAs. These are the prefixes the ABR sends into our area. Sure enough, they are the loopback (1.1.1.0) and the remote network (10.12.12.0).<\/p>\n<p>NOTE: The loopback interface is advertised as a host route of 32-bit. To change this, you can just use the command <strong>ip ospf network point-to-point&nbsp;<\/strong>under the loopback interface. This changes the network type from the loopback type for OSPF and causes the mask to advertise as it is configured.<\/p>\n<p>Now it is time to add to the story here. Let&rsquo;s configure some external prefixes and inject them into the OSPF domain. This is simple thanks to loopback interfaces. We will create some on the ATL router, run EIGRP on them, and then redistribute them into OSPF.<\/p>\n<p><img height=\"335\" src=\"https:\/\/kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net\/kajabi-storefronts-production\/blogs\/3184\/images\/D8RfcruaRMWQtgzOjdvZ_Screen_Shot_2019-07-08_at_1.55.29_PM.png\" width=\"602\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Now we have even more interesting verifications on the ORL device.

This is the default of Type 2 external OSPF routes. It means that the metric is unchanged as the prefix flows from the ASBR (Autonomous System Boundary Router) to the internal OSPF speaker. You can change the type to Type 1 if you desire when you are performing resitrubution.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps of more interest is the OSPF database:<\/p>\n<p><img height=\"661\" src=\"https:\/\/kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net\/kajabi-storefronts-production\/blogs\/3184\/images\/7Nbb1tCRRcyh0WJTB5t4_Screen_Shot_2019-07-08_at_1.57.36_PM.png\" width=\"603\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Notice now we pick up the Type 4 LSA (summary ASB link state) which is the router ID (1.1.1.1) of the ASBR (ATL). We also get the Type 5 LSAs that are the external prefixes.<\/p>\n<p>That's going to wrap up the first part of our advanced OSPF blog series. Next time, we'll take a look at creating <em>stubby areas<\/em>, <em>totally stubby areas<\/em>, <em>not so stubby areas (NSSA),<\/em>&nbsp;and <em>totally NSSA<\/em>.<em>&nbsp;<\/em>Until then, take good care.<\/p>",
